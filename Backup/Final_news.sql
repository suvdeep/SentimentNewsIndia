He noted that Vice President Joe Biden would be travelling to Europe late Monday to reassure Eastern European leaders of America&#8217;s commitment to them and that he himself would be going next week on a previously planned trip to make a similar point. Secretary of State John Kerry also is expected in Europe in the coming days. \n\n&#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continued Russian military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia&#8217;s diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russian economy.&#8221;\n\n\n<b>Putin recognises Crimea</b>\n\n\nBut administration critics said Mr. Obama&#8217;s actions were too little to convince Mr. Putin of anything. &#8220;I think Vladimir Putin must be encouraged by the absolute timidity,&#8221; said Republican Sen. John McCain, who had just returned from a weekend trip to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.\n\n\nShortly after Mr. Obama&#8217;s comments, Mr. Putin recognized Crimea as a &#8220;sovereign and independent country.&#8221;\n\n\nResidents in Crimea, a strategic Black Sea peninsula, voted overwhelmingly on Sunday in favour of the split, and Crimea&#8217;s parliament declared the region an independent state on Monday.\n\n\nThe United States, European Union and others say that splitting off Crimea from Ukraine violates the Ukrainian constitution and international law and has taken place under duress from the Russian military. Mr. Putin maintains that the vote was legal and consistent with the right of self-determination.\n\n\nThe U.S. announcement of sanctions came shortly after the European Union (EU) announced travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people the EU has linked to the unrest in Crimea. U.S. officials say there is some overlap between the U.S. list and that of the Europeans, which wasn&#8217;t immediately made public.\n\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets the targeted individuals have under U.S. jurisdiction, make it illegal for Americans to do business with them and discourage international banks and financial institutions from having relationships with them, administration officials said. The officials, however, would or could not say if those targeted actually have assets in U.S. jurisdictions. \n\n<b>Japan imposes sanctions </b>\n\n\nJapan has announced a set of sanctions against Russia for its recognition of Crimea as an independent state.\n\n\nForeign Minister Fumio Kishida said in a statement that Japan does not recognize the outcome of Crimea&#8217;s referendum to split from Ukraine, saying it violates the Ukrainian constitution.\n\n\nJapan&#8217;s sanctions involve suspension of talks on relaxing visa requirements between Japan and Russia as well as planned talks on investment, space and military.\n\n\nThe moves are seen as modest compared to sanctions by the U.S. and European Union, which have frozen the assets of individuals linked to the unrest in Crimea or who support the region&#8217;s vote to secede from Ukraine.\n\n\nMr. Kishida also urged Russia to comply with international laws, withdraw the recognition of Crimea&#8217;s independence and not move further toward its annexation.\n', 'European,comprehensive,Russian,Russian,top,similar,Ukrainian,potential,Russian,military,east,severe,further,next,similar,clear,further,isolate,diminish,international,territorial,Russian,military,diplomatic,exact,little,absolute,Republican,independent,strategic,independent,international,Russian,legal,illegal,international,financial,independent,modest,European,international,further,', ' comprehensive diplomatic independent modest potential top', ' illegal little severe', 6, -3, 3, 9),

While other countries have called for the United States to turn over the keys to the system, many businesses, dependent on the smooth functioning of the Internet for their livelihood, have expressed concern about what form the new organisation will take.\n&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to break the Internet,&#8221; said Laura DeNardis, a professor at American University and the author of <i>The Global War for Internet Governance</i>.\nLawrence E.

The civil lawsuit was filed on Friday in federal court in Manhattan. \nThe banks rigged the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, from August 2007 to at least mid-2011, the FDIC alleged. The LIBOR affects trillions of dollars in contracts around the world, including mortgages, bonds and consumer loans. A British banking trade group sets the LIBOR every morning after the 16 international banks submit estimates of what it costs them to borrow. The FDIC also sued that trade group, the British Bankers&#8217; Association. \nCitigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos declined to comment on the suit. Spokesmen for Bank of America and JPMorgan didn&#8217;t immediately return requests for comment. \nFour of the banks Britain&#8217;s Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank UBS and Rabobank of the Netherlands have previously paid a total of about $2.6 billion to settle U.S. and European regulators&#8217; charges of rigging the LIBOR. The banks signed agreements with the U.S. Justice Department that allow them to avoid criminal prosecution if they meet certain conditions. \nThe process of setting the LIBOR came under scrutiny after Barclays admitted in June 2012 that it had submitted false information to keep the rate low. \nA number of U.S. cities and municipal agencies also have filed suits against banks that set the LIBOR rate. They are seeking damages for losses suffered as a result of an artificially low rate. Local governments hold bonds and other investments whose value is pegged to LIBOR. \nUnder a change announced last July, the London-based company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Euronext, will take over supervising the setting of LIBOR from the British Bankers&#8217; Association.

It said she kept Ms. Richard&#8217;s passport with her and told the maid that it would be returned once her three-year term of employment was completed. \n\nIt also states that "escalating efforts" were made by Ms. Khobragade and others "to silence and intimidate the victim and her family and lie to Indian authorities and courts". \n\nMr. Bharara has submitted as exhibits a copy of the employment contract that Ms. Khobragade entered into with Ms. Richard that states that she will be paid $9.75 per hour salary and would be required to work for 40 hours a week. \n\nAlso submitted is a copy of the FIR filed in India in which Ms. Khobragade said she had agreed to pay Ms. Richard Rs. 30000 per month, contrary to what she had told the U.S. authorities. \n\nAccording to prosecutors, Ms. Khobragade claimed she paid the woman $4,500 a month, but actually paid her around $3 per hour and made her to work for more hours. \n\nThe indictment states that Ms. Khobragade knew the actual arrangement between her and Ms. Richard "violated U.S. laws" and so she created a "fraudulent employment contract" and had the "victim execute it". \n\n"Because it was created by Khobragade solely to deceive the US embassy during the victim&#8217;s (visa) interview," the employment contract "included false statements" that made it seem as if the diplomat&#8217;s arrangement with the "victim would comply with applicable US laws", it said. \n\nThe fresh indictment comes after Ms. Khobragade got relief from U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin who in her order on Wednesday dismissed the earlier indictment on grounds of diplomatic immunity and ordered that any open arrest warrants based on the earlier indictment should be vacated. \n\nJudge Scheindlin&#8217;s order, however, did not bar federal prosecutors from bringing new charges against the former Deputy Counsel General in a fresh indictment in future. \n\nMr. Bharara said the new indictment was returned charging Ms. Khobragade in two counts with visa fraud and making false statements ... which as alleged in the indictment, were "undertaken to facilitate her exploitative employment of a household employee who was grossly underpaid and overworked". \n\nHe further informed the court that "the government respectfully submits that time is automatically excluded from calculation under the Speedy Trial Act...which provides for the exclusion of any period of delay resulting from the unavailability of the defendant". \n\nIn this case, the defendant is unavailable because her "whereabouts are known but (her) presence for trial cannot be obtained by due diligence or (she) resists appearing at or being returned for trial". \n\nMs. Khobragade&#8217;s lawyer Daniel Arshack, who had said he was "heartened" when the previous indictment was dismissed, did not make any comment. \n\nMr. Bharara''s office said it has "no additional statement" on the fresh indictment. \n\nOn the charge of making false statements, the indictment alleges that Ms. Khobragade "willfully and knowingly did falsify, conceal and cover up, by trick, scheme and device, material facts and made materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statements and representations ...she caused to be submitted to the U.S. State Department an employment contract that she knew to contain materially false and fraudulent statements". \n\nIt said that in November 2012, Ms. Khobragade executed a "fraudulent employment agreement" that made it appear as if she had entered into an agreement with Ms. Richard that complied with U.S. labour laws. \n\nThe indictment alleges that Ms. Khobragade executed a second agreement with Ms. Richard in which the "true terms" of employment were mentioned that provided for the payment of "legally insufficient wages" of a total of Rs 30,000 ($573) monthly. \n\n"In fact Khobragade specifically deleted a provision acknowledging that she ''agrees to abide by all federal state and local laws in the US'', a provision that was mentioned in the fraudulent agreement shown to the US authorities to obtain the visa," the indictment said, adding this second agreement was never submitted to the US authorities and the diplomat "illegally underpaid and exploited the victim". \n\n"Khobragade''s decision to manufacture a fraudulent employment agreement that complied with the requirements of US laws demonstrated clearly her knowledge of the applicable legal requirements," the indictment said. \n\nMs. Richard fled from Ms. Khobragade''s Manhattan home in June 2013, after complaining to her several times of the long work hours and "harsh working conditions". \n\nMs. Khobragade and a relative of hers called Ms. Richard&#8217;s husband several times in Delhi "to pressure him to locate and disclose" Richard''s location. \n\nMs. Richard''s family was threatened that legal action would be taken against them and they were contacted by law enforcement officials, the indictment said. \n\nAt one point Ms. Khobragade also became angry with Ms. Richard when she said she should be paid according to U.S. wages, saying that the agreement signed fir the visa application process was a "only a formality created for the purpose of showing to a US embassy employee".

The New York District Court did not go into the merits of the charges against her, but decided the matter on the technical ground that she enjoyed diplomatic immunity after she was accredited to India&#8217;s Permanent Mission to the United Nations. This immunity was acquired during the pendency of criminal proceedings for allegedly giving false information to procure a visa for her housekeeper and it was a status that India cloaked her with to avoid a felony trial. India&#8217;s refusal to waive her immunity led to the host country asking her to leave. A fresh indictment, however, is still possible. This means Ms. Khobragade will never be able to return to the U.S., unless she is prepared to face fresh prosecution. India&#8217;s guarded reaction &#8212; welcoming the outcome but noting that the verdict is silent on the merits of the case as well as the legality of her unseemly arrest and intrusive body search &#8212; indicates that it expects a little more from the United States. By saying &#8220;the government hopes to see further progress in this matter in a manner consistent with international norms and conventions,&#8221; India is seeking a permanent closure of the case. A remark by a State Department spokesman that the U.S. administration is &#8220;surprised&#8221; by the court ruling is intriguing, as it knew all along that diplomatic immunity created a jurisdictional bar on her prosecution.\n\n\nThe road ahead for both the countries lies in putting behind the frostiness created by the episode and restoring their high-level engagement. Both countries understand the need to restore trust and moderation in bilateral relations. The dismissal of her indictment paves the way for this, but there are issues that remain to be addressed. India has to strengthen the principle of reciprocity in dealings with other nations. It needs to devise a code of conduct under which its officials posted abroad will not violate domestic laws. It needs a policy on consular and diplomatic officials engaging domestic workers so that there is no room for suspicion of human trafficking. On a wider canvas, the country needs legislation to protect domestic workers from under-payment and exploitation. The U.S., on the other hand, will have to introspect on its overall approach: its failure to anticipate the fallout of the arrest, the manner of the arrest and its controversial decision to &#8220;evacuate&#8221; the family of the maid at the centre of the storm in an obviously pre-emptive move.\n', 'former,bilateral,technical,diplomatic,criminal,fresh,able,fresh,silent,intrusive,further,international,diplomatic,jurisdictional,bilateral,other,domestic,consular,diplomatic,domestic,human,domestic,other,overall,controversial,', ' able diplomatic fresh', ' controversial criminal intrusive', 3, -3, 0, 6),

The chopper looked like it was trying to correct itself when it took a dive. &#8220;Next thing I know, it went into a ball of flames,&#8221; Mr. Reynolds said. \nWitnesses reported hearing unusual noises coming from the helicopter as it took off after refuelling, said Dennis Hogenson, deputy regional chief with the National Transportation Safety Board in Seattle. They also said the aircraft rotated before it crashed near the Seattle Center campus, which is home to the Space Needle, restaurants and performing arts centers. \nMayor Ed Murray noted the normally bustling Seattle Center was relatively quiet at the time. Had it been a busier day, &#8220;this would have been a much larger tragedy,&#8221; he said. In response to the crash, the city will review its policies about permitting helicopter pads, Mr. Murray said.\nInvestigators were working to document the scene and clear the wreckage, and will examine all possibilities as they determine what caused the crash, Mr. Hogenson said. A preliminary analysis is expected in five days, followed by a fuller report with a probable cause in up to a year. \nKOMO identified the pilot as Gary Pfitzner, of Issaquah. The other man killed in the crash was Bill Strothman, a former longtime KOMO photographer. Both men were working for Cahokia, Illinois-based Helicopters Inc., the leasing company that owned the Eurocopter AS350 helicopter. \nFirefighters who arrived at the scene before 8 a.m. found a &#8220;huge black cloud of smoke&#8221; and two cars and a pickup truck engulfed in flames, Seattle Fire Department spokesman Kyle Moore said. Fuel running down the street also was on fire, and crews worked to stop it before it entered the sewer, Moore said. \nAn injured man managed to free himself from a burning car and was taken to Harborview Medical Center, Moore said. The man was on fire, and KOMO reported that one of its building security guards, Brian Post, ran toward the fire to help. \nRichard Newman, 38, suffered burns on his lower back and arm, covering up to 20 percent of his body, hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg said. He was in serious condition in the intensive care unit and likely will require surgery, she said. \nTwo others who were in cars that were struck by the helicopter were uninjured. One of them, a woman, went to a police station and talked to officers, while a man from the pickup walked to a nearby McDonald&#8217;s restaurant. Police later located him unhurt. \nOnly the helicopter&#8217;s blue tail end could be identified among the wreckage strewn across the street. \nMr. Murray said the crash site could be closed for three to five days while officials with the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration probe what happened. \nMr. Lewis said it wasn&#8217;t the regular KOMO helicopter but a temporary replacement for one that is in the shop for an upgrade. \nKOMO is a block from the Space Needle and is surrounded by high-rise office and apartment buildings.

Human Rights Committee. The United States first expressed the stance in 1995 after the Clinton administration was criticised for its policy of intercepting Haitian refugees at sea, and the Bush administration later amplified it to defend its treatment of terrorism suspects in overseas prisons.\nHuman rights advocates had urged the Obama administration to reverse course, but Mary McLeod, the State Department&#8217;s acting legal adviser, told the Human Rights Committee that the United States continued to believe that the best reading of its obligations under the treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, was that it applied only on U.S. soil.\nThe U.S. presentation before the U.N. panel, which monitors compliance with the treaty, was streamed online.\nThe treaty, which the Senate ratified in 1992, bans arbitrary killings, torture, unfair trials and imprisonments without judicial review. It is a subject of debate over whether it imposes legal obligations only in connection with people inside a country&#8217;s territory or also people elsewhere who are subject to its control.\nThe U.N. panel takes the latter view, and there was a push inside the Obama administration to abandon the Clinton-Bush position. In 2011, the administration signalled that the question was under review, saying in a report that it was &#8220;mindful&#8221; that many disagreed with the position the United States had taken in the past.\nThat ambiguous comment grew out of a push during Mr. Obama&#8217;s first term by Harold H. Koh, the State Department legal adviser last confirmed by the Senate, and Michael H. Posner, the top State Department human rights official. Mr. Koh wrote a 56-page memo in 2010 concluding that the U.S. interpretation was not legally tenable; <i>The New York Times</i> published the memo last week.\nBut military and intelligence agencies have resisted changing the treaty&#8217;s interpretation out of fear that it could complicate their operations abroad, although some also argue that the law of armed conflict trumps the accord in wartime situations.\nMr. Koh and Mr. Posner stepped down in 2013 and have not been succeeded by Senate-confirmed political appointees, creating a bureaucratic vacuum, and there had been indications that the administration was not planning to embrace the view that the United States had human rights treaty obligations abroad.\nStill, it was not clear whether the administration would fully return to the Clinton-Bush position or instead leave the matter ambiguous by saying it had nothing to add to the 2011 report.

With (Pakistan) Prime Minister (Nawaz) Sharif has come new resolve to improve the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;The two areas that they have identified for cooperation I think are important to point out. One is to have a common definition of extremism and to cooperate on dealing with extremism. And the other is to come up with a broader border management framework that would address the political issues, the economic issues as well as the security issues between the two countries,&#8221; Mr. Dunford said.\n&#8220;Our role is to work on developing a constructive military-to-military relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&#8221; he said.\nReferring to his meeting with the Pakistan army chief, Mr. Dunford said that he has indicated a strong resolve to improve the relationship between the Afghan security forces and the Pakistani army as have his Afghan counterparts.\n&#8220;We will spend a lot of time over the next several months doing that. One of the things we want to accomplish by the end of the year is to have a constructive bilateral relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;Heretofore over the last few years, it&#8217;s actually been trilateral. We&#8217;ve played an important facilitating role and we hope over time to work ourselves out of that role, certainly maintain effective bilateral relationships with both countries, between the U.S. and Pakistan and U.S. and Afghanistan, but play less of a role in the important relationship between those two countries,&#8221; Mr. Dunford said.\n<b>U.S. &#8220;very carefully&#8221; watching Pak, Taliban peace talks</b>\nThe United States is very carefully watching the peace talks between the Pakistani government and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), General Joseph Dunford has told lawmakers.\n&#8220;We&#8217;re watching that very carefully. To be honest, we don&#8217;t have any insight into exactly the status of those &#8212; of those discussions. What we have seen recently is continued violence by the TTP &#8212; the Pakistani Taliban,&#8221; Gen Joseph Dunford, Commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan told lawmakers during a Congressional hearing yesterday.\n&#8220;We&#8217;ve also seen some limited military operations, particularly in the north Waziristan area against the TTP,&#8221; Mr. Dunford said in response to a question.\n&#8220;But what we know is what you know, and that is that (Pakistan) Prime Minister (Nawaz) Sharif and the leadership in Pakistan are committed to try to find some peaceful resolution and that&#8217;s certainly in Pakistan as well as in Afghanistan &#8212; what needs to happen in the long term,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s just not clear to me today if the conditions are set for constructive peace talks between the TTP &#8212;- the Pakistani Taliban &#8212; and the government of Pakistan.

A tenant said residents had complained repeatedly in recent weeks about "unbearable" gas smells. \n\nBy evening, rescue workers finally began the search for victims amid the broken bricks, splintered wood and mangled metal after firefighters spent most of the day dousing the flames. Heavy equipment, including back hoes and a bulldozer, arrived to clear the mountain of debris where the two five-storey East Harlem buildings stood. Flood lights were in place. Thermal imaging cameras were at the ready to identify heat spots bodies or pockets of fire. \n\nThe recovery was facing hardship in the form of the weather, which was expected to drop below freezing with rain. Some parts of the debris pile were inaccessible because of a sinkhole caused by a subsurface water main break, officials said. \n\nThe fiery blast, on Park Avenue at 116th Street, not far from the edge of Central Park, erupted about 9.30 a.m., around 15 minutes after a neighboring resident reported smelling gas, authorities said. The Con Edison utility said it immediately sent workers to check out the report, but they didn&#8217;t arrive until it was too late. \n\nThe explosion shattered windows a block away, rained debris onto elevated commuter railroad tracks close by, cast a plume of smoke over the skyline and sent people running into the streets. \n\n"It felt like an earthquake had rattled my whole building," said Waldemar Infante, a porter who was working in a basement nearby. "There were glass shards everywhere on the ground, and all the stores had their windows blown out." \n\nEmanuel Rivera, 24, lives on the corner of 116th and Park Avenue, across the street from the blast site. He was at home sleeping with his wife Rehanna and their two children when it happened. \n\n"All you heard was boom. The whole building shook. We looked outside and there was a bunch of smoke. Everything was in flames," he said. \n\nLike several other neighbors, Mr. Rivera said they started smelling gas on Tuesday night. \n\n"The smell of gas was there since yesterday night," he said. \n\nAnother of the people who died was Carmen Tanco, 67, a dental hygienist. \n\nPolice identified the third fatal victim as Rosaura Hernandez-Barrios, 21. The body of an adult male was pulled from the rubble just after midnight on Wednesday, according to FDNY spokesman Jim Long. He said the man was pronounced dead at the scene. \n\nPolice Sgt. John Buthorn said the body of an adult female was found among the debris around 2.50 a.m. on Thursday. He said the number of people unaccounted for is about five. \n\nAt least three of the injured were children; one, a 15-year-old boy, was reported in critical condition with burns, broken bones and internal injuries. Most of the other victims'' injuries were minor and included cuts and scrapes. \n\nA tenant in one of the destroyed buildings, Ruben Borrero, said residents had complained to the landlord about smelling gas as recently as Tuesday. \n\nA few weeks ago, Mr. Borrero said, city fire officials were called about the odour, which he said was so bad that a tenant on the top floor broke open the door to the roof for ventilation. \n\n"It was unbearable," said Mr. Borrero, who lived in a second-floor apartment with his mother and sister, who were away at the time of the explosion. "You walk in the front door and you want to turn around and walk directly out." \n\nThe fire department said a check of its records found no instances in the past month in which tenants of the two buildings reported gas odors or leaks. \n\nEdward Foppiano, a Con Ed senior vice president, said the block was last checked on Feb. 28 as part of a regular leak survey, and no problems were detected. \n\nCity records show that the building Mr. Borrero lived in was owned by Kaoru Muramatsu. A phone number listed for Mr. Muramatsu rang unanswered. \n\nCon Ed said it remains to be seen whether the leak was in a company main or in customer-installed inside plumbing. The gas main that serves the area was made of plastic and cast iron, and the iron dated to 1887, Mr. Foppiano said. \n\nA National Transportation Safety Board team arrived in the evening to investigate. The agency investigates pipeline accidents in addition to transportation disasters. \n\nJust before the explosion, a resident from a building next to the two that were destroyed reported smelling gas inside his apartment and thought the odour might be coming from outside, Con Ed spokesman Bob McGee said. Con Ed dispatched two crews two minutes after the 9.15 a.m. call came in, Mr. McGee said. But they didn&#8217;t get there in time. \n\nThe tragedy brought the neighborhood to a standstill as police set up barricades to keep residents away. Thick, acrid smoke made people&#8217;s eyes water. Some people wore surgical masks, while others held their hands or scarves over their faces. Witnesses said the blast was so powerful it knocked groceries off store shelves.

He accepted praise from Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, accorded the first question via Twitter, who said a simple &#8220;thank you&#8221; to Mr. Snowden and told him: &#8220;Your actions have been profoundly in the public interest.&#8221; The session provided a rare and extensive glimpse into the thoughts of Mr. Snowden, granted temporary asylum by Russia after the U.S. revoked his passport. He struck back against claims made again last week by the NSA director, General Keith Alexander, that his release of secret documents to the <i>Guardian</i> and other outlets last year had weakened American cyber-defences.\n&#8220;These things are improving national security, these are improving the communications not just of Americans, but everyone in the world,&#8221; Mr. Snowden said. &#8220;Because we rely on the same standard, we rely on the ability to trust our communications, and without that, we don&#8217;t have anything.&#8221; He added later that thanks to the more secure communication activity that had been encouraged by his disclosures, &#8220;the public has benefited, the government has benefited, and every society in the world has benefited&#8221;.\nMr. Snowden rejected claims that potential adversaries of the US, such as Russia and China, had obtained the files he had been carrying. &#8220;That has never happened, and it is never going to happen. If suddenly the Chinese government knew everything the NSA was doing, we would notice the difference,&#8221; said Mr. Snowden, noting that U.S. infiltration of Russia and China was extensive.\nHe sharply criticised Alexander and Michael Hayden, his predecessor as NSA director, as the two officials to have most &#8220;harmed our internet security and actually our national security&#8221; in the era since the September 11 terrorist attacks by &#8220;elevating offensive operations&#8221; over cyber-defence.\n&#8220;When you are the one country in the world that has a vault that is more full than everyone else&#8217;s, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense to be attacking all day and never defending your vault,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it makes even less sense when you let the standards for vaults worldwide have a big back door that anyone can walk in.&#8221; The 30-year-old claimed that by spending so much effort on harvesting communications data <i>en masse</i>, U.S. security agencies were failing to pick up would-be terrorists such as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the brothers alleged to have bombed last year&#8217;s Boston marathon, who had been previously flagged to the U.S. as a cause for concern by Russian authorities.\n&#8220;We are monitoring everyone&#8217;s communications rather than suspects&#8217; communications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we hadn&#8217;t spent so much on mass surveillance, if we had followed traditional patterns, we might have caught him.&#8221; Mr. Snowden also pointed to the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called &#8220;underwear bomber&#8221; who attempted to blow up a plane bound for Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. The U.S. failed to intercept him despite several opportunities, including a warning from his father to U.S. officials in Nigeria.\nAn audience of 3,500 packed into an auditorium in Austin applauded several of Mr. Snowden&#8217;s answers to questions from a pair of onstage moderators and others submitted through Twitter. Despite a glitchy and intermittent video link that he said was running through seven proxies, Mr. Snowden looked relaxed and confident.\nHe said that while the U.S. had &#8220;an oversight model that could work&#8221; to guard against excess by intelligence agencies, in reality it had proved ineffectual. &#8220;The problem is when your overseers are not interested in oversight,&#8221; he said, and &#8220;champion the NSA instead of holding them to account&#8221;.\nJames Clapper, the director of national intelligence, has admitted not telling the truth when he told a congressional hearing last year that the government was not &#8220;collecting data on millions of Americans&#8221;. Mr. Snowden said Mr. Clapper had shown officials &#8220;can lie to the country, lie to the Congress, and face not even a criticism&#8221;.\nHe encouraged ordinary internet users to protect themselves against surveillance by encrypting both their hard drives and their online activity, describing encryption as &#8220;the defence against the dark arts in the digital realm&#8221;. He also advised people to browse the web anonymously using the Tor system.\nHe urged software developers to create more user-friendly secure communications tools that could &#8220;pass the Glenn Greenwald test&#8221;, referring to Mr. Greenwald&#8217;s inability to communicate securely using PGP encryption when Mr. Snowden first approached the journalist, then working for the <i>Guardian</i>.\nHowever he warned: &#8220;If you are a target of the NSA, it is game over no matter what unless you are taking really technical steps to protect yourself.&#8221; Despite now being unable to return to the U.S., where he faces a criminal indictment, a defiant Mr. Snowden said he did not regret his decision to orchestrate the biggest leak in the history of U.S. intelligence. &#8220;Would I do this again? The answer is absolutely yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Regardless of what happens to me, this is something we had a right to know.&#8221; By the end of his interview, the audience was on its feet to deliver a standing ovation.

When is sovereignty not sovereignty? When is an unelected regime more legitimate than an elected government? The answer, it seems, is when we are discussing Ukraine. The crisis in Ukraine has swiftly turned into a global stand-off. It has also become the focus for a war of words about the meaning of freedom, democracy, legitimacy and sovereignty.\n\n\nFor many in the West, Russia&#8217;s operations in Crimea bear comparison to Hitler&#8217;s annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938. Others fear that Vladimir Putin is launching a new Cold War. Russian commentators, in the meantime, accuse the West of helping overthrow an elected government in the Ukraine, and of supporting a fascist putsch.\n\n\nWhat is rarely acknowledged in this war of words is that the conflict in Ukraine is far messier than how many wish to paint it. Consider, for instance, three of the key questions that lie at the heart the struggle in Ukraine.\n\n\n<b>Revolution or coup?</b>\n\n\nWere the events in Kiev that led to the crisis a revolution or a coup?\n\n\nMany Western commentators see the protests that led to the overthrowing of President Viktor Yanukovich as a revolution. Russian commentators view it as a fascist coup. Neither is the case.\n\n\nMr. Yanukovich&#8217;s government was corrupt, authoritarian and brutal. It was also democratically elected. The fact that Mr. Yanukovich was democratically elected does not mean that he should not have been challenged outside of the ballot box. Democracy is not just about placing a cross on a ballot paper. It is also about the creation of a robust public sphere, of a polity that is contested as much in the streets and the workplaces as in the polling station.\n\n\nThe protests against Mr. Yanukovich that erupted in Kiev&#8217;s Maidan, or Independence Square, and that eventually led to his downfall, were as much part of the democratic process as was the election of the President in the first place. They were expressions of popular unrest, no different to the mass protests against President Mohammed Morsy that engulfed Egypt last year. But the weakness of Ukraine&#8217;s liberal opposition allowed the far right to take a leading role, just as in Egypt a similar weakness of liberal organisation put the military in the driving seat. The street thugs of Pravy Sektor or &#8216;Right Sector&#8217; &#8212; a collection of hardcore neo-Nazi groups &#8212; were particularly prominent. In normal circumstances Western commentators would have denounced their presence on the streets of Kiev; because they played a useful role in the overthrow of Mr. Yanukovich, the fascists thugs have been accepted with a shrug.\n\n\nIf the protests were, at least partly, progressive and democratic, the regime that has replaced the Yanukovich government is neither. It was put together largely by the Foreign Ministers of Germany, Poland and France who helped organise the negotiations between Mr. Yanukovich and the opposition.\n\n\nThe new government has shown itself to be as authoritarian as the old one. One of its first acts was to deny regions the right to give official status to languages other than Ukrainian. The prospective law was eventually vetoed by the interim President; it was, nevertheless, a hugely symbolic move in a nation in which 40 per cent of the population speaks Russian, and another 5 per cent other non-Ukraine languages.\n\n\nWhile the overthrow of Mr. Yanukovich was clearly no fascist putsch, the new government is, nevertheless, disproportionately influenced by the far right. Representatives of two neo-fascist parties, Svoboda and Right Sector, now occupy seven ministerial posts, including that of Deputy Prime Minister and national security. Svoboda is a party that traces its roots to a Second World War partisan army allied to the Nazis and is part of the far-right Alliance of European National Movements, whose members include the British National Party (BNP); Jobbik, Hungary&#8217;s neo-fascist, anti-Semitic party; and the French Front National. Svoboda leader Oleh Tyahnybok has denounced in Parliament the &#8216;Muscovite-Jewish mafia&#8217; that he claims controls Ukraine.\n\n\nAll of Ukraine&#8217;s fascists are not simply on one side. The pro-Russian side has been pouring out anti-Semitic propaganda, claiming that the protest leaders are all Jews, and that if European liberalism gains sway, their children would be &#8216;turned gay&#8217;. What is particularly troubling, though, is that those who support the supposedly progressive, pro-European cause can acquiesce so easily to the presence of fascists in their midst.\n\n\n<b>Referendum in Crimea</b>\n\n\nShould Crimea be allowed to secede from Ukraine?\n\n\nRussia insists that the coming referendum in Crimea to determine whether or not it wishes to join the Russian federation is an expression of democracy and self-determination. Western commentators condemn it as an illegal vote contrary to international law and the Ukrainian Constitution.\n\n\nThe referendum takes place against the background of what is effectively a Russian invasion of Crimea. The presence of Russian forces and government control of the media make unlikely the possibility of a clean vote.\n\n\nThe break-up of Ukraine would be potentially disastrous, threatening bloody sectarian violence and entrenching ethnic animosities. Many groups in Crimea, Muslim Tartars in particular, are rightly fearful of the Russian embrace. Yet, the Western condemnations of the Crimean referendum miss the point. It ill-behoves governments that recently helped circumvent the Ukrainian Constitution to get rid of Viktor Yanukovich and install an unelected government to dismiss the referendum as &#8216;unconstitutional&#8217;. Nor does it help that those Western powers now insisting on the &#8216;territorial integrity&#8217; of Ukraine and defending Ukrainian sovereignty from foreign interference are the same nations that in a series of conflicts from the Balkans to Afghanistan to Iraq have helped undermine notions of national sovereignty and territorial integrity in the name of a greater good when it suited them to do so. \n\nIt is not surprising that Russian President Vladimir Putin should use the language of &#8216;protection&#8217;, &#8216;self-determination&#8217; and &#8216;opposition to fascism&#8217; to justify his military intervention in Crimea. Mr. Putin&#8217;s absurd self-justifications should not be taken seriously. But the fact that he can use such justifications reflects the way that Western actions over the past two decades have helped shape the language of &#8216;humanitarian&#8217; intervention.\n\n\nWestern politicians fail to recognise the strong sentiment that exists in large parts of Ukraine in support of close ties with Russia. A poll conducted by Kiev&#8217;s independent Razumov Centre in January last year revealed that only a third of Crimeans viewed Ukraine as their homeland, while half wanted independence. Seventy per cent wanted closer ties to Russia, compared to 20 per cent who favoured the European Union (EU). Nor are such sentiments exclusive to Crimea. The same poll found that more than half the population in eastern Ukraine wanted closer ties with Russia, whereas fewer than one in five preferred the EU.\n\n\nUkraine is a divided nation. If many in western Ukraine express their disenchantment with corrupt, undemocratic governance through greater support for the EU, many in eastern Ukraine and in Crimea do so through a yearning for closer ties with Moscow. Such pro-Russian sentiment is as important a part of Ukraine&#8217;s democratic voice as are the calls for greater integration with Western Europe. Western politicians&#8217; refusal to take seriously the pro-Russian sentiment, and their support for an unelected government in Kiev that many in Ukraine despise and even fear, can only exacerbate tensions and make more likely the disastrous break-up of Ukraine.\n\n\nIs the struggle in Ukraine a struggle between Russia and the West?\n\n\nThe roots of the current conflict lie in the struggle between Russia and the West for influence in Kiev. Many in the West have come to see that struggle for influence as synonymous with the struggle for liberal democracy. Greater Russian control is certainly likely to lead to greater repression. It is far from clear, though, that greater Western influence will in itself necessarily lead to greater liberty and democracy.\n\n\nWestern powers, while often being the loudest voices in proclaiming the virtues of democracy, have often taken an instrumental view of its desirability, preferring to prop up dictators when it suits their needs. Take, for instance, the West&#8217;s attitude towards Bahrain, a state that has, with considerable bloodshed, and not a little help from neighbouring Saudi Arabia, viciously suppressed the local movement for democratic change. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are, however, important Western allies, particularly in the &#8216;war on terror&#8217;. So the Bahraini opposition movement has been largely ignored, while a regime far more dictatorial than that of Victor Yanukovich continues to be showered with Western favours.\n\n\nThe key struggle in Ukraine is not between Russia and the West. It is for democracy and for those values often associated with the West, but not always promoted by the West. That is why, while we need to oppose Russian strongarm tactics, we need also to be sceptical of Western interference.\n\n\nWhat is black and white in Ukraine is the need for a liberal democratic society, free from corruption and external interference. But the reality of the conflict on the ground is shrouded in many shades of grey. \n\n<i>(Kenan Malik is a writer, lecturer and broadcaster)</i>\n', 'legitimate,global,many,new,many,key,Many,corrupt,authoritarian,robust,public,much,much,democratic,first,popular,different,last,liberal,similar,liberal,military,normal,useful,progressive,democratic,new,authoritarian,old,first,official,other,prospective,interim,symbolic,Russian,other,new,far,ministerial,national,French,European,progressive,illegal,international,Russian,clean,disastrous,ethnic,particular,fearful,Russian,rid,unelected,foreign,same,national,territorial,good,surprising,Russian,military,Western,past,strong,large,close,independent,last,third,such,exclusive,same,many,western,corrupt,undemocratic,many,important,democratic,Western,unelected,many,fear,likely,disastrous,current,synonymous,liberal,likely,clear,instrumental,considerable,bloodshed,local,democratic,important,dictatorial,Russian,sceptical,Western,black,democratic,free,external,many,', ' clean democratic exclusive free good important independent instrumental large legitimate liberal normal popular progressive robust strong useful', ' authoritarian black bloodshed close corrupt dictatorial disastrous fear fearful illegal', 17, -10, 7, 27),

Voters in the Crimean Peninsula will be given two options: becoming part of Russia or remaining in Ukraine with broader powers. The U.S. and Europe have declared the referendum illegitimate, saying Ukraine&#8217;s central government must be involved in decisions about its territory. \n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said Mr. Yatsenyuk&#8217;s visit was meant to signal &#8220;that we strongly support Ukraine, the Ukrainian people and the legitimacy of the new Ukrainian government.&#8221; \n\nAmid the symbolism of Mr. Yatsenyuk&#8217;s visit to the U.S., the Ukrainian leader will also be seeking financial assistance from Washington. Mr. Yatsenyuk says his country needs the West&#8217;s help to defend itself against neighboring Russia, a nation he said is &#8220;armed to the teeth.&#8221; \n\nUkraine&#8217;s parliament installed Mr. Yatsenyuk as head of the country&#8217;s interim government after pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych fled the capital of Kiev following three months of popular protests. The uprising started when Mr. Yanukovych rejected a planned partnership agreement with the European Union in favour of historical ties with Moscow. \n\nDays after Mr. Yanukovych left Kiev, Russia moved military forces into Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far brushed aside punishments levied by the West following the incursion, including visa bans, the threat of economic sanctions and a halt to planning for an international economic summit Russia is scheduled to host in June. \n\nRussia does not recognize the new government nor the elections planned in Ukraine in May. \n\nA possible path for de-escalating the dispute emerged on Tuesday, when Crimea&#8217;s parliament said that if the public votes to become part of Russia, the peninsula will declare itself independent and propose becoming a Russian state. That could give Moscow the option of saying there is no need for Crimea to become part of Russia, while keeping it firmly within its sphere of influence. \n\nMr. Yatsenyuk will be greeted at the White House Wednesday by all of the grandeur of a head of state visit, including an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Obama. The two leaders were expected to make brief comments to the media following their discussions. \n\nVice President Joe Biden, who has served as a primary administration contact with Ukraine&#8217;s old and new government, has cut short a trip to Latin America to attend the meeting. Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with Mr. Yatsenyuk in Kiev last week, is also expected to have a separate meeting with the prime minister. \n\nMr. Obama and other administration officials are expected to reinforce their commitment to boost Ukraine&#8217;s fragile new government. The U.S. has promised Ukraine $1 billion in loan guarantees, as well as technical support as it moves toward elections. \n\nMr. Obama has urged Congress to quickly approve the loan guarantee, which is supposed to supplement additional assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to vote on Wednesday on a bill that both provides aid to Ukraine and hits Russia with sanctions. \n\nA major sticking point had been a provision in the bill to enhance the lending capacity of the IMF. The Obama administration has pushed hard for acceptance of the IMF changes as part of the legislation authorizing the assistance. Sen. Bob Menendez, the committee chairman, said on Tuesday that IMF revisions would be included in the bill. \n\nThe IMF&#8217;s 2010 revisions expand the power of emerging countries within the global lending body and make some of its funds more readily available. The United States is the only country on the IMF board that hasn&#8217;t accepted the changes yet. \n\nSen. Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday he supported the IMF changes and viewed them as a &#8220;national security&#8221; concern. But several House Republicans have voiced opposition. \n\nThe House last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of the loans to Ukraine. The legislation didn&#8217;t include Russia sanctions or any language on the IMF. \n\nThe European Union has pledged $15 billion in assistance to Ukraine, though even that falls well short of the $35 billion in international rescue loans Kiev says it needs over the next two years.

The number of Americans who said weather forced them to work part time rather than full time reached the highest level for February in the 36 years that the government has tracked the figure. The average work week fell. \n\nSome recent reports hint that the economy will accelerate as the weather warms. The number of people who applied for unemployment benefits fell last week and is at about the same level as before the Great Recession. \n\nApplications essentially reflect layoffs. The decline suggests that companies are confident about future growth, because layoffs would rise if employers expected business to weaken.

Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Kerry urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stand down and said the U.S. is looking for ways to de-escalate the mounting tensions. \n&#8220;It is clear that Russia has been working hard to create a pretext for being able to invade further,&#8221; Mr. Kerry said. &#8220;It is not appropriate to invade a country, and at the end of a barrel of a gun dictate what you are trying to achieve. That is not 21-century, G-8, major nation behaviour.&#8221; \nMr. Kerry made a pointed distinction between the Ukrainian government and Mr. Putin&#8217;s. \n&#8220;The contrast really could not be clearer- determined Ukrainians demonstrating strength through unity, and the Russian government out of excuses, hiding its hand behind falsehoods, intimidation and provocations. In the hearts of Ukrainians and the eyes of the world, there is nothing strong about what Russia is doing.&#8221; \nUS President Barack Obama, visiting a Washington, D.C., school to highlight his new budget, said his administration&#8217;s push to punish Mr. Putin put the U.S. on &#8220;the side of history that, I think, more and more people around the world deeply believe in, the principle that a sovereign people, an independent people, are able to make their own decisions about their own lives. And, you know, Mr. Putin can throw a lot of words out there, but the facts on the ground indicate that right now he is not abiding by that principle.&#8221; \nSpeaking at a fundraiser later Tuesday, Mr. Obama said it might be possible for the situation to &#8220;de-escalate in the next several days and weeks.&#8221; \nMr. Obama also spoke for more than an hour on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been in contact with Putin in recent days and whose country has deep economic ties with Russia. \nThe Obama administration announced a $1 billion energy subsidy package in Washington as Mr. Kerry was arriving in Kiev. The fast-moving developments came as the United States readied economic sanctions amid worries that Moscow was ready to stretch its military reach further into the mainland of the former Soviet republic. \nMr. Kerry headed straight to Institutska Street at the start of an hours-long visit intended to bolster the new government that took over just a week ago when Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych fled. Mr. Kerry placed a bouquet of red roses, and twice the Roman Catholic secretary of state made the sign of the cross at a shrine set up to memorialize protesters who were killed during mid-February riots. \n&#8220;We&#8217;re concerned very much. We hope for your help, we hope for your assistance,&#8221; a woman shouted as Mr. Kerry walked down a misty street lined with tires, plywood, barbed wire and other remnants of the barricades that protesters had stood up to try to keep Mr. Yanukovych&#8217;s forces from reaching nearby Maidan Square, the heart of the demonstrations. \nPiles of flowers brought in honour of the dead provided splashes of colour in an otherwise drab day that was still tinged with the smell of smoke. \n&#8220;We will be helping,&#8221; Mr. Kerry said. &#8220;We are helping. President Obama is planning more assistance.&#8221; \nThe Ukraine government continued to grapple with a Russian military takeover of Crimea, a strategic, mostly pro-Russian region in the country&#8217;s southeast, and Mr. Kerry&#8217;s visit came as Mr. Putin said he wouldn&#8217;t be deterred by economic sanctions imposed punitively by the West. \nUkraine Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia told reporters that Ukraine was in a much stronger position today than it was even a week ago, having rallied the support of the U.S. and the West. He said it&#8217;s unlikely Kiev will ever go to war to prevent Russia from annexing Crimea but said doing so wouldn&#8217;t be necessary, describing the economic penalties and diplomatic isolation more painful to Russians than bullets would be. \nU.S. officials travelling with Mr. Kerry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Obama administration is considering slapping Russia with economic sanctions as soon as this week. Members of Congress say they&#8217;re preparing legislation that would impose sanctions as well. \nOfficials said the sanctions could be implemented in tiers, with an initial round of penalties targeted at individuals the U.S. says were involved in the ousted Ukrainian government&#8217;s corrupt activities. Mr. Putin is almost certain to be excluded from those penalties, the officials said, adding that it is rare for the U.S. to directly target a head of state with them. \nAs Mr. Kerry arrived, the White House announced the package of energy aid, along with training for financial and election institutions and anti-corruption efforts. Additionally, the officials said, the U.S. has suspended what was described as a narrow set of discussions with Russia over a bilateral trade investment treaty. It is also going to provide technical advice to the Ukraine government about its trade rights with Russia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be quoted by name before the official announcement was made. \nMr. Putin pulled his forces back from the Ukrainian border on Tuesday, yet said that Moscow reserves the right to use all means to protect Russians in the country but hopes it doesn&#8217;t have to. Mr. Putin declared that Western actions were driving Ukraine into anarchy and warned that any sanctions the West might place on Russia for its actions there will backfire. \nSpeaking from his residence outside Moscow, Mr. Putin said he still considers Mr. Yanukovych to be Ukraine&#8217;s leader and hopes Russia won&#8217;t need to use force in predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. \nIn Washington, the White House said the $1 billion loan guarantee was aimed at helping insulate Ukraine from reductions in energy subsidies. Russia provides a substantial portion of Ukraine&#8217;s natural gas and U.S. officials said they are prepared to work with Kiev to reduce its dependence on those imports. The assistance is also meant to supplement a broader aid package from the International Monetary Fund.

The U.S. and its international partners are in the midst of new talks with Iran aimed at forging a long&#8212;term nuclear agreement. And a U.S.&#8212;imposed April deadline for completing a framework for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians is fast approaching with few signs of tangible progress. \n\nAaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East peace adviser to presidents from both parties, said the tension sparked by the nuclear negotiations will probably force Obama to tread carefully as he presses Netanyahu on the pursuit of peace with the Palestinians. \n\n&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard for the president right now, having created a negotiation with the Iranians that the Israeli prime minister hates, to then push hard on the other issue,&#8221; said Miller, now vice president of the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars. \n\nWhile there has been progress on both high&#8212;stakes issues, the odds of reaching final agreements on either matter are low. Shortly before departing for Washington, Netanyahu vowed to &#8220;stand steadfast&#8221; on Israeli interests in the face of heavy international pressure to make concessions to the Palestinians. \n\nFor Obama, the prospect of a nuclear deal with Iran has often appeared to trump the goal of an elusive peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. After a failed attempt to jump&#8212;start peace talks in his first term, the president has largely left the current effort to Secretary of State John Kerry, who has traveled to the region nearly a dozen times over the past year. \n\n&#8220;I believe that (Netanyahu) is strong enough that if he decided this was the right thing to do for Israel, that he could do it,&#8221; Obama said in an interview with Bloomberg View. &#8220;If he does not believe that a peace deal with the Palestinians is the right thing to do for Israel, then he needs to articulate an alternative approach. And as I said before, it&#8217;s hard to come up with one that&#8217;s plausible.&#8221; \n\nThe framework Kerry is seeking would serve as guide for negotiations on a permanent solution to the long&#8212;running conflict. The framework aims to address the core issues in the dispute, including borders between Israel and a future Palestine, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the status of the holy city of Jerusalem. \n\nWhile in Washington, Netanyahu will also speak at the annual meeting of AIPAC, the largest pro&#8212;Israel lobby. Obama, who has made two previous appearances at AIPAC as president, is not scheduled to speak at this year&#8217;s event. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew addressed the conference Sunday night. \n\nThe Israeli leader&#8217;s interactions with U.S. lawmakers will be closely watched during his visit. Netanyahu has urged the U.S. not to ease sanctions on Iran during the nuclear negotiations, putting him on the side of lawmakers from both parties who have sought to increase the economic penalties during the talks. But Obama has threatened to veto any new sanctions bill, warning that more sanctions would violate the terms of the interim agreement. \n\nNatan Sachs, a fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, said Netanyahu&#8217;s alignment with American lawmakers opposed to the president is &#8220;a very touchy issue for both sides because it involves domestic issues in the United States.&#8221; \n\nThe U.S. and its international partners signed an interim agreement with Iran late last year to roll back key parts of the Islamic republic&#8217;s nuclear program in exchange for easing some of the economic penalties. Israel fears that Iran is using the negotiations with the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China to stall for time as it presses ahead with its nuclear capabilities. \n\nWhile Obama and other world leaders have expressed cautious optimism about new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Netanyahu has blasted him as a &#8220;wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing&#8221; who may be more appealing to the West but is peddling the same policies as previous Iranian regimes. \n\nThe U.S. and Israel contend that Iran is seeking to build a bomb, while the Islamic republic says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. \n\nObama and Netanyahu are also expected to discuss the violence in Syria, which is threatening to further destabilize the Middle East, as well as unrest in Egypt, the first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with Israel.

Researchers have revised a genus of cockroach in the poorly studied family Corydiidae for the first time since 1920. The revision resulted in the discovery and description of 39 new species of Arenivaga, a genus which previously held nine species, researchers said.\n\n\nThe Corydiidae family of roaches is found worldwide and its constituents are frequently found in harsh, dry habitats not usually associated with cockroaches. The study was completed over a four-year period by Heidi Hopkins, who is a cockroach taxonomic specialist and PhD candidate at the University of New Mexico, Museum of Southwestern Biology, in Albuquerque. &#8220;The extent of the radiation of this genus is quite surprising,&#8221; said Ms.Hopkins.\n\n\n&#8220;These animals have remarkable adaptations that allow them to succeed in some of the harshest places on earth.

John McCain had urged her to veto the bill, saying it would hurt the state and could alienate businesses looking to expand there. \nLoud cheers erupted outside the Capitol building immediately after Ms. Brewer made her announcement. \nThe governor said the bill &#8220;could divide Arizona in ways we could not even imagine and no one would ever want.&#8221; The bill was broadly worded and could result in unintended negative consequences, she added. \nThe bill would have allowed people to claim their religious beliefs as a defence against claims of discrimination. Democrats said the bill could allow people to break nearly any law and cite religious freedom as a defence. \nThe governor&#8217;s office said it had received more than 40,000 calls and emails on the legislation, with most of them urging a veto. \nSimilar bills are making their way through several state legislatures. Some are intended to protect gay-marriage bans, others to protect individuals or businesses who, for religious reasons, don&#8217;t want to serve same-sex couples. \nIn another closely watched case on Wednesday, a federal judge declared Texas&#8217; ban on gay marriage unconstitutional, but he left it in place until an appeals court can rule on the case. Similar rulings have been made in Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia. \nConservatives are wrestling with how to respond to the growing legality of gay marriage in the U.S. \n&#8220;This ruling is the poster child of the culture war occurring in America today,&#8221; said Todd Staples, a candidate for Texas lieutenant governor who drafted the state&#8217;s constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. \nPolls show the legal decisions come amid growing public support for gay marriage in the U.S. At least 17 states, mostly in the Northeast, and the Washington capital district now allow marriage of same-sex couples. \nBut there has been a backlash among conservatives who say &#8220;activist&#8221; judges are overturning the will of citizens who have voted to ban same-sex marriage. \n&#8220;Texans spoke loud and clear by overwhelmingly voting to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman in our Constitution, and it is not the role of the federal government to overturn the will of our citizens,&#8221; said Texas Gov. Rick Perry. \nArizona&#8217;s bill thrust the state into the national spotlight last week after both chambers of the state legislature approved it. \nThree Republicans who voted for the bill last week changed course and urged Ms. Brewer to veto it. They said in a letter to Brewer that while the intent of their vote &#8220;was to create a shield for all citizens&#8217; religious liberties, the bill has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance.&#8221; \nThe Center for Arizona Policy, a powerful social conservative group that backs conservative Christian legislation and is opposed to gay marriage, argues the law is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law. \n&#8220;We see a growing hostility toward religion,&#8221; said Josh Kredit, legal counsel for the group. \nArizona&#8217;s voters approved a ban on gay marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008. A lawsuit challenging the ban is still in its early stages. \nArizona is one of 29 states with such constitutional prohibitions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Though a welcome move, it is still only a half-measure as the next governor can overturn the moratorium. Eighteen States have abolished the death penalty. Meanwhile, a Circuit Court judge in Arkansas struck down a 2013 statute that allowed the Department of Corrections to use any form of barbiturate (anaesthetic) without making sure if the chosen drug can indeed cause death. Interventions by several States mark a general shift in lethal-injection policies. If the very act of snuffing out life in the name of death penalty is barbaric and has no place in a civilised world, carrying it out by injection makes the act all the more macabre. What makes it particularly repugnant is the complete disregard to many of the vital aspects that define a civilised society. First, prescription drugs are illegally used as part of a three-drug cocktail to achieve the opposite of what they are intended for. The anaesthetic is the first drug injected to put a convict to sleep. But the supply of the anaesthetic drug, sodium thiopental, dried up when pharmaceutical companies in Europe restricted its use for execution. Many States then turned to alternative drugs and the European companies restricted their supply too. With the European Commission imposing export controls on these drugs and the Food and Drug Administration controlling their import, the supplies truly dried up. Second, in their mindless pursuit of carrying out the death penalty, South Dakota in 2012, followed by a few other States, resorted to the unthinkable &#8212; procuring untested and illegal drugs from compounding pharmacies that are not regulated by the FDA.\n\n\nThird, States have been changing their execution protocols frequently due to drug scarcity; Ohio even started using a single-dose protocol. Since the dosages, and the effectiveness of the drugs in causing painless and immediate death have never before been tested in humans, lethal injections remain nothing but human clinical trials in progress; it is a modern-day equivalent of Nazi doctors experimenting on prisoners. Little wonder that a few convicts have shown visible signs of extreme and prolonged suffering prior to death. These cases fly in the face of the central notion that lethal injection reduces suffering. Finally, an area of extreme concern is the active involvement of medical practitioners in carrying out executions. The involvement of doctors in administering lethal injections in the name of reducing cruelty defies logic and runs counter to their professional ethic of saving lives.\n', 'next,anaesthetic,several,general,very,barbaric,repugnant,complete,many,vital,opposite,anaesthetic,first,anaesthetic,pharmaceutical,few,other,unthinkable,illegal,due,immediate,lethal,human,clinical,few,visible,central,lethal,active,medical,lethal,professional,ethic,', ' active vital', ' barbaric illegal lethal repugnant unthinkable', 2, -5, -3, 7),

Besides, the company argued that the filmmakers and not the actors of &#8220;Innocence of Muslims&#8221; owned the copyright and only they could remove it from YouTube. \nTypically, that&#8217;s the case with the vast majority of clips posted on YouTube and Hollywood in general that don&#8217;t violate decency laws and policies. But the 9th Circuit said on Wednesday that this case was far from typical and that the actress, Cindy Lee Garcia, retained a copyright claim that YouTube must respect. That&#8217;s because she believed she was acting in a different production than the one that ultimately appeared online. \n&#8220;Had Ms. Garcia known the true nature of the propaganda film the producers were planning, she would never had agreed to appear in the movie,&#8221; said Cris Armenta, Ms. Garcia&#8217;s attorney. \nGoogle argues that the actress had no claim to the film because filmmaker Mark Basseley Youssef wrote the dialogue, managed the entire production and dubbed over Ms. Garcia&#8217;s dialogue during postproduction editing. \nWriting for the court, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski said the ruling was not a blanket order giving copyright protection to every actor, but that in this case, Ms. Garcia&#8217;s performance was worthy of copyright protection. \nYoussef, the filmmaker, was sentenced to 21 months in prison for cheque fraud in 2010 and barred from accessing the Internet without court approval. He was returned to prison in 2012 for violating terms of his probation and was released on probation in September 2013. \nMs. Garcia was paid $500 to appear for five seconds in a film she was told was called &#8220;Desert Warrior&#8221; that she thought had nothing to do with religion or radical Islam. When the clip was released, her lines were dubbed to have her character asking Muhammad if he was a child molester. \n&#8220;This is a troubling case,&#8221; Judge Kozinski wrote. &#8220;Ms. Garcia was duped into providing an artistic performance that was used in a way she never could have foreseen. Her unwitting and unwilling inclusion in Innocence of Muslims led to serious threats against her life. It&#8217;s disappointing, though perhaps not surprising, that Ms. Garcia needed to sue in order to protect herself and her rights.&#8221; \nFor Google, the ruling represents a nettlesome issue if allowed to stand. The company fears that bit players and extras appearing in popular clips will now be emboldened to send takedown notices to YouTube unless settlements can be reached with the filmmakers. \nGoogle Inc., which has removed the clip, said it will appeal the decision to a special 11-judge panel of the appeals court. The next move after that would be to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. \n&#8220;We strongly disagree with this ruling and will fight it,&#8221; said Google spokeswoman Abbi Tatton.

Mr. Obama later responded that he hoped a truce would &#8220;provide space for the sides to resolve their disagreements peacefully.&#8221; \n&#8220;Ultimately the government&#8217;s responsible for making sure that we shift toward some sort of unity government, even if it&#8217;s temporary, that allows us to move to fair and free elections so that the will of the Ukrainian people can be rightly expressed without the kinds of chaos we&#8217;ve seen on the streets, without the bloodshed that all of us, I think, strongly condemn,&#8221; Mr. Obama said at an evening news conference with his fellow North American leaders. \nMeanwhile, the European Union called an extraordinary meeting of its 28 member countries on Thursday to address the situation. \nFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters in Paris that he and his counterparts from Germany and Poland would travel to Ukraine, meeting with the Ukrainian government and opposition before the emergency EU meeting. EU sanctions would typically include banning leading officials from traveling to the EU countries and freezing their assets there. \nMr. Obama said he is monitoring the Ukrainian violence &#8220;very carefully.&#8221; \n&#8220;We expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint and to not resort to violence when dealing with peaceful protesters,&#8221; Mr. Obama said. \nSecretary of State John Kerry, in Paris for meetings with Fabius and others, said he was disturbed by the level of abuse demonstrated by the Ukrainian government and protesters. \n&#8220;We are talking about the possibility of sanctions or other steps in order to create the atmosphere for compromise,&#8221; he said. \nIt was not immediately clear Wednesday what sort of sanctions or penalties the U.S. could impose. \nState Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said visa restrictions already have been imposed against some members of the Ukrainian government, and cited &#8220;different kinds of individual sanctions that can be levied&#8221; without being specific. She said officials are still trying to determine who is responsible for the violence and described a sense of urgency within the Obama administration &#8220;to make decisions very, very soon about what we will do next.&#8221; \nDeadly clashes between police and anti-government protesters in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev on Tuesday left at least 25 people dead and hundreds injured. \nBen Rhodes, Mr. Obama&#8217;s deputy national security adviser, told reporters travelling with Mr. Obama aboard Air Force one that what happened Tuesday was &#8220;completely outrageous&#8221; and will be a factor in U.S. decision-making. \nRhodes said there was still time for the Ukrainian government to avoid sanctions or other punishment by pulling back its &#8220;riot police,&#8221; respecting people&#8217;s right to protest peacefully, releasing protesters who have been arrested and pursuing a &#8220;serious dialogue&#8221; with the opposition about how to unify the country. \nA senior State Department official, who is closely following the unrest in Ukraine, said Wednesday that U.S. officials were concerned about the Ukrainian president&#8217;s decision to replace the army chief. The military has announced that it would take part in a national anti-terrorist operation to restore order. U.S. officials have been able to stay in direct contact senior security force leaders in the Ukrainian government, but in the past 24 hours that has been difficult because they are not answering their phones, the official said. \nThe official was not authorized to be quoted by name and would brief reporters only on condition of anonymity. \nIn January, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev revoked existing visas of Ukrainians the U.S. suspected were complicit in violence against protesters in December. On Wednesday, the U.S. denied admission to the United States for about 20 individual Ukrainians the U.S. believes are responsible for the actions against the most recent violence Tuesday night in Kiev&#8217;s Independence Square, also known as the Maidan. This action means that if they were to apply for visas, they would be denied. \nThe official said these individuals represent the &#8220;full chain of command that we consider responsible for ordering security forces to move against the Maidan yesterday.&#8221; \nOn Capitol Hill, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said they were working on legislation that would impose narrowly focused sanctions against Ukrainians who have committed, ordered or supported acts of violence against peaceful protesters, or who are complicit in a rollback of Ukraine&#8217;s democracy. \n&#8220;There must be consequences for the escalation of violence in Ukraine,&#8221; they said in a statement. &#8220;Unfortunately, that time has now come.&#8221; \nMr. Obama was asked at the news conference whether he sees Russia&#8217;s hand in the intransigence of the Ukrainian and Syrian governments and whether violent clashes in both countries have turned into a tug of war between the U.S. and Russia. Mr. Obama said although Russia clearly has influence with both governments, the turmoil has come from people voicing their desire for basic freedoms. \n&#8220;Our approach in the United States is not to see these as some Cold War chessboard in which we&#8217;re in competition with Russia.

The FAA is developing new rules as the technology makes drones far more versatile, but for now operators can run afoul of regulations by using them for commercial purposes, including journalism. \n\nThe case of the Hartford crash, in which the victim&#8217;s body was left hanging out of a mangled car, highlights some of the safety, privacy and ethical issues that journalists will wrestle with as interest grows in using drones for newsgathering. \n\n&#8220;Here was a dead body still on the scene. We had covered it the best we could,&#8221; said Lt. Brian Foley, a Hartford police spokesman, who said drones have been appearing more frequently at crime scenes. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want the family to see that.&#8221; \n\nThe station&#8217;s general manager, Klarn DePalma, said it constantly evaluates new technology and is eager to see regulations spelled out for drones, but he said the temporary employee in question was not on assignment for them and has never been paid for drone video. \n\n&#8220;We don&#8217;t even own a drone,&#8221; he said. \n\nThe FAA said on Monday that it has issued 12 warning letters to drone operators, which can include orders to stop operations. It said in a statement that its investigations are intended to determine whether operators violated FAA safety regulations. \n\nA law passed by Congress two years ago requires the FAA to integrate unmanned aircraft of all sizes into the domestic airspace by late 2015, but it&#8217;s clear the agency won&#8217;t meet that deadline. The FAA has been working for more than four years on regulations to permit small drones those weighing less than 55 pounds to be used for commercial purposes, but it has missed deadline after deadline for proposing those regulations. \n\nLast month, the FAA again moved back the date it expects to propose those regulations to November of this year. Even then, it will be just a proposal. It takes months and often years before proposed regulations become final. \n\nThe FAA is tackling small drones that are flown under about 400 feet below where most manned aircraft fly first because they&#8217;re the easiest. Regulations to permit commercial use of larger drones are even further behind. \n\nDrones hold appeal for journalists because they would allow new perspectives and access, particularly in areas that are not reachable by helicopter or could pose dangers to people. New models can cost as little as $500. But regulators have to weigh free-speech considerations against concerns for safety and invasion of privacy. A small handful of media organisations have received warning letters since 2011, when an iPad newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp. was flagged for using a drone to film tornado damage around the country, according to Matt Waite, a journalism professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Last July, the journalism schools at Nebraska and the University of Missouri-Columbia were ordered to stop flying drones outdoors until they obtain government authorisation. \n\nMr. Waite, who founded the university&#8217;s Drone Journalism Lab in 2011, said that once permission for commercial drone use is granted, journalists will need to consider psychological distress that a dozen or more drones buzzing overhead could cause people who become targets of media attention.

But Mr. Obama made no promises to frustrated Canadian leaders about his long-anticipated decision on the Keystone XL pipeline.\nClosing a day of talks with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, Mr. Obama said the North American partners must maintain their &#8220;competitive advantage&#8221; on trade, in part by expanding into the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. While Mr. Obama acknowledged that &#8220;elements in my party&#8221; oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, he disputed the notion that Democratic concerns would derail the agreement.\n&#8220;We&#8217;ll get this passed if it&#8217;s a good agreement,&#8221; Mr. Obama declared during a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\nThe North America Leaders&#8217; Summit often referred to as the &#8220;Three Amigos&#8221; meeting coincided with the 20th year of the North American Free Trade Agreement among the three countries, a deal that has vastly expanded cross-border commerce in the region but which remains a contentious issue in the United States over its impact on jobs and on environmental protections.\nTrade experts say the agreement is due for an upgrade to take into account the current globalized environment and to address issues not touched in the original pact. But rather than reopen NAFTA, the three countries are instead relying on negotiations underway to complete the TPP, which is a trade bloc of 12 countries in the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.\nPena Nieto heralded the &#8220;innovative spirit&#8221; that spurred NAFTA and said new trade agreements &#8220;are bound to go beyond and enhance all together the progress that each one of our countries has made.&#8221; And Harper made clear that he was &#8220;focused on bringing those negotiations to a successful conclusion.&#8221;\nDespite the widespread agreement on trade, there were some sources of tension between the North American partners on immigration and the Keystone XL pipeline, both sensitive political issues in the United States.\nIn Mexico, government officials and the public alike are eager for progress in overhauling U.S. immigration laws. The prospects for sweeping legislation this year has dimmed in recent weeks, with many House Republicans unwilling to tackle the issue in a midterm election year.\nStill, Mr. Obama declared, &#8220;Immigration reform remains one of my highest priorities.&#8221;\nFor Canada, a key source of frustration with the U.S. has been the Obama administration&#8217;s long and drawn out review of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from tar sands in western Canada 1,179 miles to Nebraska, where existing pipelines would then carry the crude to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast. Canada has been pushing the U.S. for years to approve the pipeline, but environmental groups oppose it, and Mr. Obama has said he won&#8217;t approve it if it increases greenhouse gas emissions.\nA Nebraska judge on Wednesday struck down a law that allowed the pipeline to proceed through the state, a victory for opponents who have tried to block the project.\nWhile Mr. Obama acknowledged that the U.S. review has been &#8220;extensive,&#8221; he defended the process, saying &#8220;these are how we make these decisions about something that could potentially have significant impact on America&#8217;s national economy and our national interests.&#8221;\nA final decision on Keystone isn&#8217;t expected until this summer, at the earliest, meaning the verdict could potentially come in the run-up to November&#8217;s midterm elections, in which energy issues are likely to be a factor in some key races.\n&#8220;My views in favour of the project are very well known,&#8221; Mr. Harper said.\nEvents elsewhere in the world competed for the leaders&#8217; attention, most notably the violence that erupted in Ukraine as the government of President Viktor Yanukovych cracked down on protesters. Mr. Obama warned that there would be consequences if the clashes continued. Mr. Obama cautiously noted reports of a truce between the president and the protesters, saying it &#8220;could provide space for the sides to resolve their disagreements peacefully.&#8221;\nMr. Obama spent just about nine hours in Toluca, the Mexican leader&#8217;s hometown, with Air Force One touching down Wednesday afternoon and returning to Washington shortly after the evening news conference.', 'fraught,stalled,overhaul,Canadian,Democratic,good,joint,20th,contentious,environmental,due,current,globalized,original,reopen,new,clear,successful,widespread,sensitive,political,eager,sweeping,recent,many,key,western,crude,environmental,significant,national,national,final,likely,key,', ' democratic eager good original sensitive significant successful sweeping', ' contentious crude fraught widespread', 8, -4, 4, 12),

The Interior Ministry said 10 police officers died and 383 were wounded, including 74 who received gunshot wounds. The Ministry insisted that police were using only rubber bullets, while protesters fired live ammunition. Radicals seized over 1,500 firing arms and 100,000 bullets in the last 24 hours, according to security services. \n\nPolice cleared several streets overnight, but failed to oust protesters from Maidan or Independence Square, where they had been camping since the start of protests three months ago. On Wednesday afternoon street battles resumed with security forces trying to push the protesters from the square. \n\nAfter weeks of indecision and manoeuvring President Viktor Yanukovych appears to have finally resolved to get tough with the protesters. \n\nIn a televised address to the nation on Wednesday, Mr. Yanukovych said the opposition leaders had &#8220;crossed a line when they called people to arms.&#8221; \n\nThe Ukrainian leader repeated his call for talks with the opposition, but warned that &#8220;violators of law must stand trial.&#8221; \n\nAuthorities sealed off Kiev from the rest of the country, halting transportation by rail, bus and cars in order to prevent activists from pro-Western Ukraine to reinforce protests in the capital. The Defence Ministry confirmed media reports that at least one elite paratrooper unit was heading to Kiev &#8220;to guard weapon arsenals.&#8221; \n\nRussia threw its weight behind Mr. Yanukovych, squarely blaming the opposition for the deadly violence and condemning it as &#8220;a coup attempt.&#8221; \n\n&#8220;In the opinion of the President [Vladimir Putin], full responsibility for what is happening in Ukraine lies with extremists, whose actions are seen in Moscow as an attempted coup d&#8217;Ã©tat,&#8221; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday.

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he expected the alliance to take &#8220;targeted measures against those responsible for violence and use of excessive force&#8221; at the EU Foreign Ministers&#8217; emergency meeting on Thursday. \n\nMoscow, for its part, addressed to the opposition the demand &#8220;to stop violence and immediately resume dialogue with the lawful authorities without threats and ultimatums.&#8221; \n\nFor the first time since the start of the protests Russia promised to intervene in the crisis. \n\n&#8220;Ukraine is a friendly sister nation and strategic partner for Russia, and we will use all our leverage to restore peace and calm in the country,&#8221; the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued on Wednesday. \n\nThe latest flare up of violence highlighted the rift between Ukraine&#8217;s West and pro-Russia East.

(93, '413', 'February 18, 2014', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/for-an-unfettered-internet/article5699615.ece', '\nA global debate has been raging on the issue of the mechanisms and principles of Internet Governance (IG) ever since the exposÃ© that the United States and the National Security Agency (NSA) were engaged in wide-ranging mass surveillance of international traffic. Brazil is holding a global multistakeholder meeting in April on this issue, while the European Union (EU) has released a communiquÃ© on &#8220;Europe&#8217;s Role in Shaping the Future of Internet Governance.&#8221; The issue boils down to the mechanisms and the role of various stakeholders in this space.\n\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) pegs Internet reach at 40 per cent of all households in the world and 2.7 billion people online. The good news is nearly 1.3 billion are women; the Internet has bridged the gender divide with nearly an equal number of women as men being online. About 200 million are in India with Internet penetration being a measly 11.4 per cent; 95 per cent use social media online, with roughly 90 million being Indians. The Internet has become an intrinsic part of our daily lives in our pursuit of knowledge, information, innovation, entertainment and in articulating dissent.\n\n\nThe year 2013 will widely be known as the one in which whistle-blower Edward Snowden told us that powerful governments had pierced the cover of privacy that is so dear to us and which is at the core of free expression. The Indian government&#8217;s position, in 2011, at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), and yet again in November 2013 in another U.N. meeting, has been to demand &#8220;a multilateral body for the formulation of international Internet related public policies.&#8221; The government would like this body to be under the aegis of the U.N. &#8220;with all stakeholders and relevant international organizations in &#8216;advisory capacity&#8217; within their respective roles.&#8221;\n\n\nThere is no denying that the current Internet Governance (IG) framework is imperfect, especially with the U.S.&#8217;s strong influence and legal proximity to IG-related mechanisms &#8212; all these need to be transformed for the Internet to become more democratic and inclusive. Given the emerging issues and the changing nature of the conflicts, and the fact that the discourse within the IG space is broken, these existing processes cannot address these concerns sufficiently. A lot of fixing, enabling and rethinking and even strengthening is required. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), is a good place to start; decentralisation and renegotiating ICANN&#8217;s cozy relationship with the U.S., as rightly pointed out by the EU, are some of the steps that need to be undertaken. However, the position taken by India will only take global IG out of the frying pan into the fire, from the &#8220;influence&#8221; of one country to the control of global governments who, consistent with the U.N. Charter, will make all decisions behind closed doors, with hardly any voice for other stakeholders or participation in active, meaningful dialogue, leave alone decision-making.\n\n\nWhile the U.N. does excellent work in peacekeeping and developing friendly relations among nations, it has severe limitations of expertise, speed, and above all, transparency, when it comes to decisions related to Internet policy. \n\n<b>Key reasons for a review</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few key reasons why India&#8217;s position needs to be reviewed. \n\nFirst, the Internet belongs to all, connects 2.7 billion people, and is a premier source of information, knowledge and communication. Therefore, all decisions regarding the Internet must involve multistakeholder groups, representing government, industry, academia, technical community, civil society, media and the youth, on an equal footing. Every stakeholder contributes to the growth of the Internet. No serious stakeholder should be denied access to either dialogue or decision-making. This is an impossibility under a U.N. body, whose Charter prohibits membership beyond &#8220;member states&#8221; (governments only). Even reaching Geneva or New York for a U.N. hosted meeting would require government approval before issuance of a visa. Since a vast majority of governments are flawed democracies, authoritarian and dictatorships, access for multistakeholders under a U.N. body is all but blocked.\n\n\nSecond, the U.N. body makes policies and laws which take the form of treaties and conventions. Following this, national laws such as the Indian Telegraph Act, the TRAI Act and the IT Act need to be amended and future legislation will need to ensure compliance. This supersedes the rights and duties of our MPs and Parliament, who, as elected representatives, have the primary responsibility to make national laws which govern Indian citizens. Any such proposal that sits atop Parliament&#8217;s lawmaking privilege should have its approval. This doesn&#8217;t.\n\n\nThe Internet today is also the world&#8217;s largest media &#8212; bigger than any newspaper or television channel. Any decision or treaty by a U.N. body which has the memberships of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships on an &#8220;equal footing,&#8221; can easily ensure excessive powers to the State on censorships, takedowns and blockings. This goes against the heart of free speech and human rights &#8212; another reason why a U.N. body with government bureaucrats alone should not make such decisions without the presence of civil society, media and free speech activists.\n\n\nNext, an intergovernmental body, from within or outside the U.N., is not obliged to engage any stakeholder. While India&#8217;s position relegates them to an &#8220;advisory&#8221; role, the U.N. body, when formed, will make its own rules. Who participates, when and with whose approval &#8212; even in an &#8220;advisory&#8221; capacity &#8212; would be subject to the decision of governments who alone can be members of such a body. \n\nOne of the most spectacular values of the Internet is permissionless innovation. Technical and commercial decisions are made in &#8220;Internet time,&#8221; which ensures that the web meets and exceeds user expectations. A government body &#8212; that too following U.N. processes, notwithstanding its good intentions &#8212; will be farthest from swift decision-making, multistakeholder collaboration or innovation. Even with high-level policy decisions, such a body could unintendedly harm the Internet, through delays and conventional thinking.\n\n\nThen, there is the issue of expertise. Unintended but bad policies related to IG can adversely impact its day-to-day functioning. Expertise from multiple sources is key to the Internet&#8217;s growth. What forms a broad policy mandate for a bureaucrat is everyday work for an Internet techie or a free speech activist. Internet policy decisions therefore need to include the view of: the private sector, which invests thousands of crores each year, in telecom, Internet social media infrastructure, technology, mobile devices and spectrum, etc.; a stable environment from a policy perspective which reflects the domestic ethos and which is a prerequisite for fuelling innovation and growth of and through the Internet for India; civil society which protects free speech, privacy and human rights; the technical community which ensures that the web works like clockwork every time; and academia and the media, who are not only one of the biggest users of the Internet, only second to the youth, but in fact provide valuable inputs in keeping it democratic, free and effective. These stakeholders, especially those who represent a developing country&#8217;s perspective &#8212; and who possess the expertise &#8212; need to be at the table and not kept waiting to be called, as &#8220;advisers.&#8221;\n\n\nFinally, there is the issue of recourse against badly drafted laws, a case in point being the draconian Section 66A of the Information Technology Act. In India, a domestic law such as the IT Act and Rules can be appealed, and courts will take cognisance and even jump to protect the individual rights of citizens, free speech and privacy. However, if an international treaty allows for example &#8220;blocking of content based on cultural sensitivity,&#8221; then the bureaucracy can interpret it broadly as it wishes without any recourse for Indian citizens under the Indian legal system.\n\n\nThere is admittedly a need for intergovernmental dialogue and decisions in areas of cyber security, child pornography, jurisdiction disputes and a few orphan issues, where gaps exist. It is not that multistakeholders must sit and weigh in on all these meetings. But these form a small part of the overall IG space. They need to be addressed, but not at the cost of destroying an inclusive, transparent, multistakeholder decision-making process which upholds the core Internet values of a universal, equitable Internet for common good, empowerment and justice for all.\n\n\nIn this regard, broad global IG principles which lead to a democratic, collaborative, transparent and inclusive decision-making process are perhaps a good place to start with. Brazil and the EU have taken the lead. India, as the world&#8217;s largest democracy, must review its stance and claim its rightful position in the world as a leader which gave the world new ideas of resilience, non-violence and truth. It is time for change; to put the public back in public policy and IG with the least amount of government control for an unfettered, spirited and vibrant Internet of the future &#8212; of the people, places and things that India dreams of, and to facilitate access and celebrate diversity, cherish pluralism and the multiplicity of opinion and voices. \n\n<i>(Subi Chaturvedi is a member of the multistakeholder advisory group of the U.N.-IGF and co-chair of the Brazil Meeting on the Future of the Internet, April 2014)</i>\n', 'global,international,global,various,equal,intrinsic,daily,powerful,dear,free,multilateral,international,public,relevant,international,respective,current,imperfect,strong,legal,democratic,good,cozy,global,global,other,active,meaningful,few,key,technical,civil,equal,serious,vast,authoritarian,national,such,future,primary,national,govern,such,authoritarian,excessive,free,such,free,intergovernmental,own,subject,such,spectacular,commercial,good,such,conventional,bad,key,broad,free,private,social,mobile,domestic,prerequisite,technical,second,valuable,democratic,free,draconian,domestic,such,individual,free,international,cultural,Indian,legal,intergovernmental,few,weigh,small,overall,inclusive,equitable,common,good,empowerment,broad,global,democratic,collaborative,inclusive,good,rightful,new,public,unfettered,vibrant,celebrate,cherish,', ' active broad civil cozy dear democratic empowerment equitable free good inclusive meaningful powerful relevant rightful spectacular strong unfettered valuable vast vibrant', ' authoritarian bad draconian excessive imperfect serious', 21, -6, 15, 27),

Russia is a holdout". The U.S. President bluntly asserted that John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, and others "have delivered a very direct message to the Russians that they cannot say they are concerned about the well-being of the Syrian people when there are starving civilians. ... [I]t is not\njust the Syrians that are responsible; the Russians, as well, if they are blocking this kind of resolution".\nBut the Russians, fully alive to the use of humanitarian intervention by the West for engineering "regime change" in Libya earlier, seemed hardly impressed by the presidential diatribe. In his spirited riposte, Russian deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov pointed out that any resolution at the UN must also take into account the threat posed by al-Qaeda and affiliated organisations in Syria. "It is necessary to deal both with the terrorist threat and the humanitarian disaster in a comprehensive manner," he observed.\nOn Friday, President Obama had warned that fresh pressure would be mounted on the government of Syrian President, Bashar Al Assad. Accompanied by Jordan''s King Abdullah II, he stressed that "there are\ngoing to be some immediate steps that we have to take to help the humanitarian assistance there (in Syria)".\nThe President''s remarks coincided with a report in the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>(WSJ) that Saudi Arabia has offered to supply the Syrian opposition with anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, apparently to offset the air and heavy weapons advantage over the opposition that the government forces currently exercise. The <i>WSJ</i> write-up observed that Russian-made antitank guided missiles and Chinese man-portable air-defence systems have already been stored in warehouses in Jordan and Turkey.\nSyrian opposition commanders had struck a deal on the new armaments shipment during a meeting with agents from the United States and Saudi intelligence in Jordan on January 30, the daily reported.\nAttempts to mount fresh military pressure on the Syrian government have coincided with a sterile on-going dialogue that has been going on in Geneva between the official representatives and the opposition.\nThis has caused Russia to pointedly accuse U.S. and France of attempting to derail talks in the Swiss city. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, blamed Paris and Washington on Friday of making a systematic attempt to provoke the Syrian government to "slam the door" at the Geneva-2 peace conference. He added that Moscow supported the Syrian government''s approach to implement step-by-step, the broad principles anchored by the 2012 Geneva communiquÃ© to achieve durable peace. Observers say that the opposition wants to first discuss the composition of a transitional government during the dialogue in the hope of using diplomacy to remove President Assad from power.

Both sides believe the case won&#8217;t be settled until the Supreme Court decides to hear it or one like it. \n\nJudge Allen&#8217;s ruling makes Virginia the second State in the traditionally conservative U.S. South to issue a ruling recognising the legality of gay marriages. \n\nA judge in Kentucky ruled on Wednesday that the State must recognise same-sex marriages performed in other States. It did not rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriages inside the State, however. The Virginia judge&#8217;s ruling also follows similar decisions in Utah and Oklahoma federal courts. \n\nThe Virginia Attorney-General&#8217;s Office took the unusual step of not defending the law because it believes the ban violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. However, it asked for the judge to stay her order to avoid a situation like what happened in Utah after a federal judge declared that State&#8217;s ban on gay marriages unconstitutional. \n\nMore than 1,000 gay and lesbian couples were married in the days after the ruling before the U.S. Supreme Court granted the State an emergency stay, halting the weddings and creating a cloud of uncertainty for the status of the married couples. Soon after, a federal judge also declared Oklahoma&#8217;s ban unconstitutional. That ruling is also on hold while it is appealed. \n\nIn a movement that began with Massachusetts in 2004, 17 States and the District of Columbia now allow gay marriage, most of them clustered in the Northeast. None of them is in the old Confederacy. \n\nThe Virginia case centred on a gay Norfolk couple who were denied a marriage license by a court in July, shortly after the Supreme Court struck down the federal Defence of Marriage Act. A couple who married in California and are raising a teenage daughter also later joined the lawsuit, seeking to have their marriage recognised in Virginia. The attorneys representing the plaintiffs are the same ones who successfully challenged California&#8217;s voter-approved ban on gay marriages in court. \n\nOpponents of the Virginia ban say the issue resonates in Virginia in particular because of a landmark 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving a Virginia couple and interracial marriage. \n\nMildred and Richard Loving were married in Washington, D.C., and were living in Virginia when police raided their home in 1958 and charged them with violating the state&#8217;s Racial Integrity law. They were convicted but prevailed before the Supreme Court. \n\nDuring verbal arguments in the case, Virginia Solicitor-General Stuart Raphael said that the ban on gay marriage is legally indistinguishable from the ban on interracial marriage. He said the same arguments to defend the ban now are the same ones that were used back then, including that marriage between two people of the same sex has never been historically allowed. Mr. Raphael also said supporters have failed to prove how allowing gay marriage would make heterosexual couples less likely to marry. \n\nIn defending the law, the attorney for the Norfolk clerk said that the issue is best left for the General Assembly and the voters to decide. \n\nNationwide, there are more than a dozen States with federal lawsuits challenging state bans on same-sex marriage.

In his State of the Union address to Congress on January 28, Mr. Obama said the mission there would be completed by the end of the year, and that thereafter the U.S. and its allies would support a &#8220;unified Afghanistan&#8221; as it took responsibility for itself. With the agreement of the Afghan government, a &#8220;small force&#8221; could remain to train and assist Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism operations against any al-Qaeda remnants. Washington has withdrawn 60,000 of its troops from Afghanistan since Mr. Obama took office in 2009, but 36,500 remain, with 19,000 from other countries in the NATO-ISAF coalition. Western plans are for a residual force of 8,000 to 12,000, two-thirds of them American, but sections of the U.S. military have suggested a U.S. strength of 10,000, with 5,000 from the rest of the coalition.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai is yet to sign the deal for NATO-ISAF troops to stay; he would prefer his successor to sign the agreement after he leaves office in April 2014, but the successor will not take office until September. Secondly, Mr. Karzai has infuriated Washington by planning to release 37 Taliban detainees, by blaming American forces for terrorist attacks on civilians, and by calling the U.S. a &#8220;colonial power.&#8221; Yet the Afghan National Security Forces, which include the police, number 334,000, or about 20,000 below the numbers envisaged for them, and the U.S. Department of Defense has reported to Congress that the ANSF cannot operate on their own. The U.S. public have little wish to continue the war, but the military may have its own agenda. The September 2013 quarterly report by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction shows that of nearly $100 billion in reconstruction aid, $97 billion went towards counter-narcotics, security, and other operations; only $3 billion was used for humanitarian aid. If the President feels hemmed in, it is because of the toxic legacy of his predecessor George W. Bush who went into the country in search of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda.

Dozens of officers at Malmstrom have been linked to cheating on a monthly test of their proficiency in handling &#8220;emergency war orders&#8221; for potential launch of nuclear missiles. \nThe U.S. Navy said its implicated sailors are accused of having cheated on written tests they must pass to be certified as instructors at a nuclear propulsion school at Charleston, South Carolina. The Navy uses two nuclear reactors there to train sailors for duty aboard any of dozens of submarines and aircraft carriers around the world whose onboard reactors provide propulsion. They are not part of any weapons systems. \nThe accused sailors had previously undergone reactor operations training at Charleston before deploying aboard a nuclear-power vessel. In the normal course of career moves, they returned to Charleston to serve as instructors, for which they have to pass requalification exams. \nAdm. John Richardson, director of the Navy&#8217;s nuclear propulsion program, said an undisclosed number of senior sailors are alleged to have provided test information to their peers. He was not more specific, but one official said the information was shared from the sailors&#8217; home computers, which could be a violation of security rules because information about nuclear reactors operations is classified. \n&#8220;That&#8217;ll be an active part of the investigation to fully understand&#8221; the extent of any security rule violations, Adm. Richardson said. He said the last time the Navy had such a cheating scandal involving its nuclear reactor operators was in 2010 when the USS Memphis, a nuclear-powered submarine, lost about 10 percent of its crew to disciplinary measures after a cheating ring was discovered. \nHe said the alleged cheating at Charleston came to light on Monday when a senior enlisted sailor at the training site reported it to higher authorities. He added the unidentified sailor &#8220;recognized that this was wrong&#8221; and chose to report it. \nThe matter was still under investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations, said at a joint announcement with Adm. Richardson that he was upset to learn of the breakdown in discipline. \n&#8220;To say I am disappointed would be an understatement,&#8221; Adm. Greenert said. &#8220;We expect more from our sailors especially our senior sailors.&#8221; \nNeither Adm. Greenert nor Adm. Richardson identified the rank of the alleged cheaters but described them as senior enlisted members. There are about 150 nuclear power reactor instructors at the Charleston site. With about 30 of them banned, at least temporarily, from performing their duties, the training program might suffer. \n&#8220;I could possibly foresee an impact in Charleston,&#8221; Adm. Richardson said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see if that is broader.&#8221; \nPressed to say how many sailors were implicated in the investigation, Adm. Richardson said a &#8220;ballpark figure&#8221; was something like 12 to 20. But a short time later, another Navy official said the number was approximately 30 but could change as the investigation unfolds. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss publicly any details beyond what Adm. Richardson and Adm. Greenert disclosed at their news conference. \nAdm. Richardson said he could not discuss possible disciplinary action against those involved because the probe was ongoing. However, he said that anyone in the naval nuclear power program either in a training setting or aboard a ship at sea who is caught cheating would usually be removed from the program and &#8220;generally&#8221; would be kicked out of the Navy. \nThe decision to have Adm. Greenert and Adm.

Paul Oetken in Manhattan approved the deal, which calls for JPMorgan to pay the money within a month and install an improved quality control program to review loans it underwrites using a federally maintained software application that determines if a loan qualifies for government insurance. \nJPMorgan said in a statement that its deal with federal prosecutors, the Federal Housing Administration, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs &#8220;represents another significant step in the firm&#8217;s efforts to put historical mortgage-related issues behind it&#8221;. \nThe New York-based company said it had already reserved the money for the settlement and any financial impact from exposure to future claims wasn&#8217;t expected to be significant. \nIn a release, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the company had for years participated in federally subsidised programs meant to make homes more affordable for millions of Americans. \n&#8220;Yet, for more than a decade, it abused that privilege,&#8221; he said. &#8220;JPMorgan Chase put profits ahead of responsibility by recklessly churning out thousands of defective mortgage loans, failing to inform the government of known problems with those loans and leaving the government to cover the losses when the loans defaulted.&#8221; \nThe prosecutor acknowledged, however, that the company had accepted responsibility and promised to reform the flawed practices. \nThe U.S. government said the bank approved thousands of loans for government insurance or refinancing that didn&#8217;t meet the requirements of federal programs and failed to self-report hundreds of loans it identified as having been affected by fraud or other deficiencies. It also regularly submitted loan data that lacked integrity because it was not based on documents or other information it possessed when employees submitted the data, the government said. \nAssociate Attorney General Tony West said the deal &#8220;recovers wrongfully claimed funds for vital government programs that give millions of Americans the opportunity to own a home and sends a clear message that we will take appropriately aggressive action against financial institutions that knowingly engage in improper mortgage lending practices.&#8221; \nIn November, JPMorgan agreed to pay $ 13 billion to settle a civil inquiry into its sales of low-quality mortgage-backed securities that collapsed in value in the 2008 financial crisis.

This is quite in contrast to their equanimous reaction in December when the stimulus-reduction programme was launched. This is attributed to the fact that the announcement of January 29 completely ignored the concerns of emerging- market countries. Many of them were under pressure even earlier and the announcement, without acknowledging the volatility that it had already caused, offered no respite to a number of countries, from Argentina to South Africa. Their currencies weakened, in some cases precipitously. Their stock markets fell in conjunction and bond markets reacted violently. Threatened with a possible choking of easy money, investors started selling emerging market stocks and currencies to invest in the developed countries that offer better risk-adjusted returns at this juncture. Predictably, many central banks of developing countries hiked interest rates to stabilise their currencies, but with mixed results. India has shown greater resilience this time compared to many other similarly placed economies, and even in relation to its record last September when the news of a possible tapering sent global markets into a tizzy. Improved macroeconomic fundamentals and the RBI&#8217;s determination to check inflation have boosted investor confidence. However, given that growth rates are still sluggish and given the possibility of fiscal slippages, India will continue to faces challenges. Over-reliance on short-term flows to bridge balance of payments has been the bane of external sector management, and at times like this the policy shortcomings stand exposed.\n\n\nThere are two broad lessons to be drawn from the taper and the reactions to it. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has pointed out that policy coordination among countries has been a casualty. In the immediate post-crisis period, emerging economies helped boost global demand through well-coordinated fiscal stimulus programmes. A complete synchronisation of monetary and fiscal policies might not be possible in practice but certain seminal policy measures such as the U.S. taper do require wider consultation and coordination among countries. This has been the consensus view at several forums &#8212; including the G-20 and IMF-World Bank meetings. Second, it needs to be noted that U.S. monetary policy is framed with reference to the U.S. economy. The gradual withdrawal of the stimulus is dependent on the U.S. economy reaching some well defined milestones such as reduction in unemployment. The ongoing taper signals a stronger U.S. economy, and that should be good news for India and other emerging economies &#8212; at least in the long run.\n', 'recent,further,monthly,equanimous,possible,easy,developed,many,central,many,other,last,possible,global,macroeconomic,sluggish,fiscal,external,broad,immediate,global,fiscal,complete,monetary,fiscal,possible,certain,seminal,such,several,gradual,such,good,other,long,', ' broad easy good', ' sluggish', 3, -1, 2, 4),

Backed by many of Silicon Valley&#8217;s top investors and executives at Google, Facebook, Yahoo and other tech companies, Mr. Khanna, a 37-year-old patent lawyer who has never held elected office, has mounted an aggressive campaign for the seat from the 17th Congressional District in the heart of the Valley.\n\n\nMr. Khanna&#8217;s ambitions, and those of the tech elite behind him, are clear. A Democrat, Mr. Khanna is trying to oust a fellow Democrat, Representative Michael M. Honda, who remains popular after seven terms and has been endorsed by President Obama and the rest of the Democratic establishment. Using the jargon of tech start-ups, Mr. Khanna says he will be a &#8220;disruptive&#8221; force in Washington.\n\n\nThanks to tech&#8217;s support, Mr. Khanna has significantly outraised Mr. Honda. Four months before the primary, the challenger has $1,975,000 in cash on hand, or more than triple the incumbent&#8217;s $623,000, according to campaign finance records filed last Friday.\n\n\nWhether or not this political start-up is ultimately successful, Mr. Khanna&#8217;s campaign underscores the tech industry&#8217;s push to elect candidates who will further its interests in Washington, even if that means, as in this race, trying to replace a party stalwart with a relative unknown.\n\n\nA liberal, pro-labour Democrat with a passion for civil rights, Mr. Honda, 72, is generally regarded as being on the side of the tech industry, but not as aggressive a champion as other congressmen in the region.\n\n\n&#8220;The tech community is looking for advocates who will be really, really outspoken for tech, and Ro fits that mold,&#8221; said Ron Conway, who is one of the industry&#8217;s most influential investors and is backing Mr. Khanna. While it is unusual for tech leaders to rally in such a way around a candidate, Mr. Conway added, &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s a wave of the future that continues, because it&#8217;s crucial for the tech community to have a really active voice in Washington.&#8221;\n\n\nMr. Khanna, who was a deputy assistant commerce secretary from 2009 to 2011 and now represents tech companies in intellectual property cases at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, one of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most prestigious law firms, talks of the need for &#8220;Government 2.0&#8221; and a &#8220;reset&#8221; of Congress.\n\n\nThe author of &#8220;<i>Entrepreneurial Nation</i>,&#8221; a book on manufacturing and American competitiveness, he has been endorsed by Google&#8217;s executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt; Facebook&#8217;s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg; Yahoo&#8217;s chief executive, Marissa Mayer; and many other tech luminaries. After knocking on the doors of potential voters here in Sunnyvale on a recent afternoon, Mr. Khanna said of his list of tech endorsers, &#8220;Everyone who is seen as a person of the future has endorsed our campaign.&#8221;\n\n\nFacing a serious challenge for the first time since being elected to Congress in 2000, Mr. Honda said he represented the interests not only of tech companies but also of the wider district. &#8220;It&#8217;s about experience, the time you spent in the community, your record and people&#8217;s expectations,&#8221; he said recently, after leading a seminar on science education at Cisco&#8217;s headquarters in San Jose.\n\n\nAt a time when the tech industry has drawn a backlash in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the tech elite are increasingly portrayed as concerned with their narrow privileges at the expense of society at large, Mr. Honda&#8217;s supporters have labelled Mr. Khanna a &#8220;Silicon Valley groupie&#8221; whose wealthy donors are trying to buy a congressional seat.\n\n\n<b>Venturing forth</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSilicon Valley has traditionally stayed aloof from politics. But richer and more powerful than ever, the tech industry has become increasingly involved, both in lobbying and in fund-raising. And some of its boldface names have shown strong support for particular candidates, including Cory Booker of New Jersey in his successful run for the United States Senate and Mayor Ed Lee of San Francisco&#8217;s campaign for a full term.\n\n\nMany of Mr. Khanna&#8217;s backers were behind Mr. Lee&#8217;s election, particularly Mr. Conway. In a fund-raiser for Mr. Khanna last year, Sean Parker, a founder of Napster, is seen in a video shot by <i>The San Francisco Chronicle </i>saying, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re starting to come into a realisation of our own power and of our own capability, not just as innovators and technology pioneers, but also in a political sense.&#8221;\n\n\nTech support has also given Mr. Khanna the means to hire political advisers who worked on Mr. Obama&#8217;s re-election campaign, including Jeremy Bird, the former national field director.\n\n\nRusty Rueff, a tech industry veteran, said he was an example of Silicon Valley&#8217;s political transformation. Apolitical until 2011, when he began backing Mr. Obama, Mr. Rueff, 51, now sits on a committee advising Mr. Khanna, only the second political candidate he has supported.\n\n\n&#8220;His formative years, he&#8217;s had a screen in front of him, and then not only has he grown up around it, he&#8217;s written about it, he&#8217;s been involved on the legal side,&#8221; Mr. Rueff said. &#8220;He identifies with us, and we identify with someone who thinks that way.&#8221;\n\n\nFor his part, Mr. Honda, a former public-school teacher, held several local and state public offices before going to Congress. He is a Japanese-American whose views on politics and civil rights were molded by his family&#8217;s internment during World War II. Over the years, Mr. Honda has nurtured many Asian-American political candidates, some of whom are in the 17th District, the first majority Asian-American district in the mainland United States.\n\n\nLarry Gerston, a political scientist at San Jose State University, said that while Mr. Honda had supported the tech industry over the years, he had defined himself through his passionate campaigns for the poor, public education and civil rights. &#8220;He bleeds little guy,&#8221; Dr. Gerston said.\n\n\nMr. Honda&#8217;s aides said the congressman had supported immigration changes, science education, nanotechnology and other issues that Silicon Valley cares about. They point to Intel, Google, Oracle, Yahoo and other tech companies whose political action committees are helping in his re-election.\n\n\nAsad Jamal, chairman of ePlanet Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, said he was backing Mr. Honda because of his support of technology as well as his socially progressive issues.\n\n\n&#8220;Silicon Valley has a culture of backing new people in start-ups, and Ro is very persuasive and a good candidate,&#8221; Mr. Jamal said. &#8220;But Mike is exceptional and has a proven track record.&#8221;\n\n\nDilawar Syed, another tech entrepreneur backing Mr. Honda, said Silicon Valley cares about broader issues beyond tech, including social justice, and is not monolithic. &#8220;You have to look at the whole thing and not get confused by the endorsements of some individuals,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nStill, the list of Silicon Valley individuals endorsing Mr. Khanna &#8212; which also includes Marc Andreessen, the Netscape co-founder; John Doerr, the venture capitalist; and Randi Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Zuckerberg Media and the sister of Mark Zuckerberg, a Facebook founder &#8212; has given the challenger instant credibility. The average size of individual contributions to Mr. Khanna&#8217;s campaign is double to triple those of Mr. Honda&#8217;s. In the latest filing, of the 220 individual donors to Mr. Khanna&#8217;s campaign, 27 listed their occupation as &#8220;C.E.O.,&#8221; four as &#8220;chief financial officers&#8221; and about 40 as being involved in investments.\n\n\nThe money gives Mr. Khanna an advantage in what could become one of the costliest congressional races in the nation.\n\n\nThough both candidates are Democrats, they are expected to face each other in a general election in November under California&#8217;s top-two primary system, after a primary in June.\n\n\nA Republican candidate, Vanila Singh, an anesthesiologist who, like Mr. Khanna, is Indian-American, is also running in the solidly Democratic district.\n\n\nPointing to the example of Meg Whitman, the tech executive who spent part of her fortune in an unsuccessful bid for governor in California, Mr. Honda said: &#8220;We know that money is not everything. People in this area understand that you need funds, but you don&#8217;t buy the election.&#8221;\n\n\nBut Mr. Honda&#8217;s supporters have gone further. \n\nDemocracy for America, the group founded by Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, endorsed Mr. Honda while describing Mr. Khanna as a &#8220;Silicon Valley groupie&#8221; and a candidate &#8220;whose big-money donors are intent on buying Mike&#8217;s congressional seat.&#8221;\n\n\nMr. Khanna, whose campaign has not accepted donations from political action committees, waved away that accusation. He said he simply had a better understanding of the global economy and of Silicon Valley&#8217;s place in it. For example, he said, he favours changes to tax policy suitable for a global economy, including ones that would make it easier for American companies to repatriate overseas profits without being taxed under certain conditions.\n\n\n&#8220;I wear tech groupie as a badge of honour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fundamental difference in our campaign.&#8221;\n', 'political,many,top,other,aggressive,fellow,popular,Democratic,primary,triple,last,political,successful,push,relative,aggressive,other,influential,unusual,such,crucial,active,tech,intellectual,prestigious,Entrepreneurial,American,executive,many,other,potential,recent,serious,first,large,wealthy,congressional,powerful,strong,particular,successful,full,last,own,own,political,political,former,national,political,second,political,formative,legal,former,several,local,public,civil,many,political,17th,first,political,poor,public,little,other,other,political,progressive,new,persuasive,good,exceptional,social,whole,individual,double,individual,financial,congressional,other,general,primary,primary,Democratic,unsuccessful,former,intent,congressional,political,global,suitable,global,American,overseas,certain,fundamental,', ' active civil democratic exceptional good influential large persuasive popular potential powerful prestigious progressive strong successful suitable top wealthy', ' little poor serious unsuccessful unusual', 18, -5, 13, 23),

The figures from 2012 and 2013 showed that companies, such as Google and Microsoft, were compelled by the government to provide information on as many as 10,000 customer accounts in a six-month period. Yahoo complied with government requests for information on more than 40,000 accounts in the same period. \n\nThe companies earlier provided limited information about government requests for data, but a new agreement reached last week with the Obama administration allowed the firms to provide a broadened, though still circumscribed, set of figures to the public. \n\nSeeking to reassure customers and business partners alarmed by revelations about the government&#8217;s massive collection of Internet and computer data, the firms stressed details indicating that only small numbers of their customers were targeted by authorities. Still, even those small numbers showed that thousands of Americans were affected by the government requests approved by judges of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. \n\nThe data releases by the five major tech firms offered a mix of dispassionate graphics, reassurances and protests, seeking to alleviate customer concerns about government spying while pressuring national security officials about the companies&#8217; constitutional concerns. The shifting tone in the releases showed the precarious course that major tech firms have had to navigate in recent months, caught between their public commitments to Internet freedom and their enforced roles as data providers to U.S. spy agencies. \n\nIn a company blog post, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith scolded the U.S. and allied governments for failing to renounce the reported mass interception of Internet data carried by communications cables. Top lawyers and executives for major tech firms had previously raised alarms about media reports describing that hacking by U.S. and UK spy agencies and cited them during conversations with U.S. officials during President Barack Obama&#8217;s internal review of planned changes to the government&#8217;s spying operations. \n\n&#8220;Despite the president&#8217;s reform efforts and our ability to publish more information, there has not yet been any public commitment by either the U.S. or other governments to renounce the attempted hacking of Internet companies,&#8221; Mr. Smith said in a Microsoft blog release. Smith added that Microsoft planned to press the government &#8220;for more on this point, in collaboration with others across our industry.&#8221; \n\nThe new figures were released just a week after major tech firms announced a legal agreement with the Justice Department. But lawyers and executive for the companies openly vented their discomfort with the government&#8217;s continuing insistence that they could only provide broad ranges instead of the actual numbers of government requests. \n\nThe companies said they would press for narrower data ranges that would offer more details. \n\nA spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the companies&#8217; releases and comments. The spokesman pointed to a late January statement by DNI James Clapper and Attorney General Eric Holder that said the agreement would allow the firms to &#8220;disclose more information than ever before to their customers.&#8221; \n\nGoogle and all the other companies denied that they gave any government unfettered access to their users&#8217; info. The companies are worried more people will reduce their online activities if they believe almost everything they do is being monitored by the government. A decline in Web surfing could hurt the companies financially by giving them fewer opportunities to show online ads and sell other services. \n\nThe companies can only reveal how many total requests they receive every six months, with the numbers in groupings of 1,000. And even those general numbers must be concealed for at least six months after any reporting period ends. That restriction means the FISA requests for the final half of last year can&#8217;t be shared until July, at the earliest. \n\nThe data coming out Monday indicated the U.S. government is digging deeper into the Internet as people spend more time online. \n\nMost of the companies showed the number of government requests fell between 0 and 999 for each six&#8212;month period. But the numbers of customers affected by those searches ranged more widely. \n\nGoogle, for instance, has seen the number of people affected by FISA court orders rise from 2,000 to 2,999 users during the first half of 2009 to between 9,000 and 9,999 users during the first half of last year. The company showed an unusual spike in the number of Americans whose data was collected between July and December 2012. During that period, metadata was collected from between 12,000 and 12,999 users. Under the restrictions imposed by the government, no explanation was provided for that anomaly. \n\nYahoo listed the highest number of people swept up in FISA requests for online content during the first half of last year. The orders seeking user content spanned 30,000 to 30,999 accounts, according to the company. The requested content could have included emails, instant messages, address books, calendar items and pictures. \n\nAll the companies also received FISA requests that weren&#8217;t aimed at scooping up online communications or photos. Those demands sought things such as billing information and locations of where people made an Internet connection. \n\nGoogle described Monday&#8217;s disclosure as a positive step while promising to keep fighting for the right to provide more precise numbers about the FISA requests and more specifics about the data being sought. &#8220;We still believe more transparency is needed so everyone can better understand how surveillance laws work and decide whether or not they serve the public interest,&#8221; Richard Salgado, Google&#8217;s legal director of law enforcement and information security, wrote in a blog post. \n\nEven if the companies can share more information about the FISA requests, they still might face doubts raised by other National Security Agency documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden asserting that U.S. government has found ways to tap into the lines transmitting personal information between data centers. The companies are trying to thwart the hacking by encrypting most, if not all the data, stored on their computers. \n\n&#8220;The limited information that can be gleaned from the reports suggests that the government is using its spying powers extremely broadly, likely infringing on the privacy rights of many innocent Americans,&#8221; said Alex Abdo, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. \n\nMeanwhile, a conservative lawyer who has challenged the constitutionality of the NSA&#8217;s daily collection of phone data said he had filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and review his case. Attorney Larry Klayman said he had mailed a petition to the top court asking it to intervene in the case, which is already under appeal. \n\nJudge Richard Leon, the presiding U.S. district judge in the case, ruled last December that the NSA programme had constitutional flaws. Mr. Leon has held off shutting the programme down pending court appeals.

Carl Levin, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Levin&#8217;s office released the letter, dated Jan. 26, on Sunday.\nMr. Levin and several other committee chairmen have expressed a willingness to hold off on sanctions to give diplomatic efforts a chance. However, 59 Republicans and Democrats back legislation to impose a new round of penalties on Iran, maintaining that crippling economic sanctions forced Tehran to make concessions.\nThe legislation, sponsored by Sens. Bob Menendez and Mark Kirk would blacklist several Iranian industrial sectors and threaten banks and companies around the world with being banned from the U.S. market if they help Iran export any more oil. The provisions would only take effect if Tehran violates the six-month interim deal or lets it expire without a comprehensive nuclear agreement.\nIran agreed in November to slow its uranium enrichment program to a level that is far below what would be necessary to make a nuclear bomb. It also agreed to increased international inspections to give world leaders confidence that it is not trying to build weapons in secret.\nIn exchange, the U.S. and five other nations Britain, Germany, France, Russia and China agreed to ease an estimated $7 billion worth of international sanctions against Iran&#8217;s crippled economy for a six-month period while negotiators try to broker a final settlement.\nIran has long maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.\nMs. Clinton said the intelligence community has said new sanctions could undercut the chances for a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran.\n&#8220;I share that view. It could rob us of the diplomatic high ground we worked so hard to reach, break the united international front we constructed and in the long run, weaken the pressure on Iran by opening the door for other countries to chart a different course,&#8221; said the former New York senator and possible 2016 presidential candidate.\nIn his State of the Union address this past week, Mr. Obama repeated his threat to veto any new Iran sanctions if Congress passes legislation.\nMs. Clinton, who said she repeatedly backed Iran sanctions during her eight years as senator, cautioned lawmakers.\n&#8220;If the world judges rightly or wrongly that negotiations have collapsed because of actions in the United States Congress, even some of our closest partners abroad to say nothing of countries like Russia and China may well falter in their commitment.

Facing an April deadline, Israel is working against a backdrop of increasing international pressure to reach a deal, coupled with a growing call for boycotting Israel over its settlements in areas it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. \n\nA small but growing number of European businesses and pension funds have begun to drop investments or limit trade with Israeli firms involved in the West Bank settlements. At a security conference in Germany this weekend, Mr. Kerry warned that a breakdown in Israeli-Palestinian talks would accelerate this trend and could threaten Israel&#8217;s economic prosperity and its safety. \n\n&#8220;You see for Israel there&#8217;s an increasing de-legitimization campaign that has been building up. People are very sensitive to it. There are talk of boycotts and other kinds of things,&#8221; Kerry said. &#8220;Today&#8217;s status quo absolutely, to a certainty, I promise you 100 percent, cannot be maintained. It&#8217;s not sustainable. It&#8217;s illusionary. There&#8217;s a momentary prosperity, there&#8217;s a momentary peace.&#8221; \n\nAt the opening of his weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said international pressure on Israel would backfire and only cause the Palestinians to harden their positions. \n\n&#8220;Attempts to impose a boycott on the State of Israel are immoral and unjust. Moreover, they will not achieve their goal,&#8221; he said. \n\nWhile Netanyahu refrained from taking aim at Kerry, some of his ministers were harsher. Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, of Netanyahu&#8217;s ruling Likud party, called Kerry&#8217;s comments &#8220;offensive, unfair and insufferable.&#8221; \n\n&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect the state of Israel to conduct negotiations with a gun pointed to its head,&#8221; he said. \n\nEconomics Minister Naftali Bennett, from the religious, pro-settler Jewish Home party, said all &#8220;the advice givers&#8221; should know that Israel will not abandon its land because of economic threats. \n\n&#8220;We expect our friends around the world to stand beside us, against anti-Semitic boycott efforts targeting Israel, and not for them to be their amplifier,&#8221; said Bennett, a fierce critic of the Kerry-led talks. &#8220;Only security will bring economic stability, he said. \n\nTzipi Livni, Israel&#8217;s chief negotiator, came to Kerry&#8217;s defense, saying he was merely expressing concern for Israel&#8217;s future. \n\nAiming to clarify, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Kerry&#8217;s only reference to a boycott was a description of actions undertaken by others that he has always opposed. \n\n&#8220;Secretary Kerry has a proud record of over three decades of steadfast support for Israel&#8217;s security and well&#8212;being, including staunch opposition to boycotts,&#8221; she said in a statement. &#8220;Secretary Kerry has always expected opposition and difficult moments in the process, but he also expects all parties to accurately portray his record and statements.&#8221; \n\nOver the past six months, Kerry has held endless back-and-forth talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes of reaching a framework for a peace agreement. He is expected to present his ideas in the coming weeks and both sides have balked at some of his expected proposals. \n\nIsraeli nationalist leaders like Bennett, for instance, oppose a Palestinian state that is based on the pre-1967 borders. More than 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 war and which the Palestinians now hope will be part of their future state. Known to religious Jews as Judea and Samaria, they are parts of the biblical land of Israel and hard-liners object to ceding either area on both spiritual and security grounds. Any expected peace accord would put the fate of dozens of settlements at risk. \n\nBut European officials have warned that Israel could face deepening economic isolation if it presses forward with the construction of more settlements. In the latest example, Denmark&#8217;s largest bank, Danske Bank, blacklisted Israel&#8217;s Bank Hapoalim because of its links to settlement construction. \n\nOnce dismissed as a fringe issue, the boycott threat is now increasingly taking center stage in Israeli public debate. \n\nIsraeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid recently said that even in the case of a limited boycott that reduces Israeli exports to the European Union by 20 per cent, the damage would amount to about 20 billion shekels ($5.7 billion) in exports annually. \n\nIn a related development, Mr. Lapid also ordered that all payments to settlements be stopped until their use is clarified. The move followed a TV report that said funds were allegedly being illegally transferred to the Yesha Council an umbrella groups of settlers that was illicitly using the money for political purposes.\n', 'further,long,international,small,European,economic,sensitive,other,momentary,momentary,weekly,international,immoral,unfair,religious,Jewish,economic,beside,critic,economic,steadfast,difficult,past,Palestinian,live,east,future,religious,biblical,spiritual,deepening,economic,related,political,', ' live sensitive spiritual steadfast', ' critic deepening difficult immoral unfair', 4, -5, -1, 9),

Mr. Zarif described it as a &#8220;good meeting.&#8221; \n\nIran and the International Atomic Energy Agency struck a deal Nov. 11 granting U.N. inspectors wider access to Iran&#8217;s nuclear facilities.

Security Council plus Germany. \n\n&#8220;What I can promise is that we will go to those negotiations with the political will and good faith to reach an agreement, because it would be foolish for us to only bargain for six months that would be (a) disaster for everybody,&#8221; Zarif said. \n\nZarif said Iran and the international community needed to restore mutual trust, and said Tehran&#8217;s end goal was &#8220;a good solution a balanced solution.&#8221; He added that &#8220;an unbalanced solution is inherently not stable.&#8221; \n\n&#8220;Believe me, you do not possess the monopoly on mistrust there is a lot of mistrust in Iran,&#8221; he told the audience. &#8220;Iranians believe, with good reason, that the West wants to deprive Iran of its ability to have access to technology.&#8221; \n\nZarif said that &#8220;the answer at the end of the day is you need to put aside all narratives and take concrete steps.&#8221; \n\nUnder the six&#8212;month deal, Iran has agreed to halt its 20 percent enrichment program, which produces uranium just steps away from military grade, but will continue enrichment up to 5 percent. It also will convert half of its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium to oxide, and dilute the remaining half to 5 percent. \n\nIn return, the U.S. and the EU simultaneously announced the lifting of sanctions on petrochemical products, insurance, gold and other precious metals, passenger plane parts and services.

flies were found in a sample storage room, and there was inadequate control over samples and non-adherence of procedures in sample analysis.\n\n\nYet, what is evident from a closer reading of the full Form 483, which The Hindu obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request from the FDA, is that the bulk of the report was, in fact, about what could be interpreted as deliberate falsification of data, rather than any involuntary slip-ups in adhering to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).\n\n\nFor example, &#8216;Observation 1&#8217; on the first page of the report, said that the inspection, carried out during January 5-11, 2014, discovered that &#8220;finished API [Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient] analytical results found to be failing specifications or otherwise suspect are retested until acceptable results are obtained [and] failing or otherwise suspect results are not reported&#8221;.\n\n\nIn the same page, the FDA inspectors noted that this &#8220;practice of overwriting electronic raw data files for ongoing sample sequences until acceptable results are achieved,&#8221; occurred so many times during the review of five months worth of data that the number of such cases of falsification &#8220;could not be quantified during our inspection due to the large amount of data.&#8221;\n\n\nThe following four or five pages of the 11-page report comprise detailed examples of specific instances of data falsification, typically involving Ranbaxy personnel over-writing the results of various drug tests recorded electronically on an earlier date.\n\n\nThe second key observation made on page six of the inspectors&#8217; report was that &#8220;samples were not analysed according to established laboratory test method procedures,&#8221; under which the FDA again found numerous results not reported, and a lack of written procedures and documentation of test results.\n\n\nAdditional observations made during the inspections include &#8220;Appropriate controls are not established over computerised systems,&#8221; &#8220;records are not completed contemporaneously,&#8221; the latter suggesting that Ranbaxy analysts and other personnel were &#8220;back-dating&#8221; testing records or log books.\n\n\nUnder the fifth observation made by the inspectors, that &#8220;Laboratory samples are not adequately controlled to prevent mix-ups,&#8221; the report seemed to hint at deliberate attempts made to avoid detection of any drug or test quality issues.\n\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration report notes under this observation that despite the inspectors&#8217; request on a previous day for the Ranbaxy personnel to retain two vials in the &#8220;QC analytical laboratory, &#8220;Upon return to the laboratory&#8230; we found that these two vials had been discarded [and] during the course of our inspection the identity/fate of these&#8230; vials could not be determined.&#8221;\n\n\nThe final three observations, bringing the total of what appear to be serious deviations from cGMP to eight, &#8220;the FDA inspectors discovered inadequate laboratory facilities, incomplete records on the maintenance of manufacturing equipment and inappropriately calibrated analytical instruments.&#8221;\n\n\nThe latest action taken by the FDA to halt all imports into the U.S. from Ranbaxy&#8217;s Toansa facility comes in the wake of the company being fined $500 million last May for seven felony charges relating to manufacturing fraud, to which the firm pled guilty.\n\n\nWhile two Ranbaxy facilities, in Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh and Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, had faced import restrictions and curtailment by the FDA prior to that settlement, a third facility, in Mohali, Punjab, was hit with a similar import alert last September when the FDA found tablets with embedded with a black fibre that could have been a hair from an employee&#8217;s arm or tape fragments.\n\n\nThe founders of the firm, Malvinder and Shivinder Singh sold Ranbaxy to Japanese Daiichi-Sankyo in 2008 for about $4.6 billion, though the FDA&#8217;s investigation suggests that the company acknowledged violations of cGMP regulations with regard to a U.S.-distributed drug Sotret, in 2003.\n\n\nThe subsequent case against the firm brought by the U.S. Department of Justice was built on a large trove of evidence collected by whistleblower and former Ranbaxy Director Dinesh Thakur.\n', 'Last,numerous,generic,giant,inadequate,evident,full,deliberate,involuntary,current,first,analytical,suspect,acceptable,suspect,same,electronic,acceptable,many,such,due,large,specific,various,second,key,established,numerous,other,fifth,deliberate,previous,analytical,final,total,appear,serious,inadequate,incomplete,analytical,last,third,similar,last,embedded,black,Japanese,subsequent,large,former,', ' acceptable established large', ' black inadequate incomplete involuntary serious suspect', 3, -6, -3, 9),

He faces a total of 30 separate counts, of which 17 are said to carry the death penalty.\nAlthough the crime carries a capital sentence, only three people are said to have been executed by the U.S. government since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and in approximately half of all such cases, federal prosecutors &#8220;eventually withdraw the threat of capital punishment before trial, more often than not as part of a plea deal.&#8221;\nDavid Coleman Headley, alleged mastermind of the Mumbai terror attacks was one such case. He has successfully avoided the death penalty under a plea bargain with the U.S. even though the Mumbai strike for which he was said to have done reconnaissance work, resulted in the killing of 164 people and the wounding of at least 308.\nFurther, as noted by Slate magazine, Mr. Tsarnaev&#8217;s odds of escaping the death penalty are favourable given that he is being defended by Judy Clarke, the defence lawyer who has kept several &#8220;high-profile public enemies off of death row,&#8221; including Susan Smith, who drowned her two children in 1994; the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski; Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph; and most recently Arizona shooting suspect Jared Loughner.\nThe announcement of the prosecution&#8217;s intention to seek the death penalty comes in the wake of a sharp debate on whether the use of the lethal injection constitutes &#8220;cruel and unusual punishment,&#8221; particularly after the case of multiple prisons across U.S. states began grappling with lethal drug shortages and have been accused of using &#8220;experimental&#8221; procedures.\nMost recently Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire (53) visibly gasped for air and snorted as it took approximately 25 minutes for him to die under a new lethal injection protocol followed by the state, entailing the use of previously untested drugs.\nAnother inmate, Michael Wilson, who was executed using pentobarbital at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary for a murder 20 years ago, gasped his final words, &#8220;I feel my whole body burning.&#8221;\nMany U.S. states with capital punishment have had to turn to lethal drugs such as pentobarbital after the main sedative used traditionally, sodium thiopental became unavailable due to its sole manufacturer, a company called Hospira, halting production in 2010.\nIn the Tsarnaev case a Boston Globe poll conducted last September suggested that 57 per cent of Boston residents wanted him to get a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, whereas 33 per cent preferred to see him receive the death penalty.', 'suspect,past,relevant,applicable,first,dramatic,local,federal,malicious,separate,federal,such,federal,mastermind,such,favourable,several,public,sharp,lethal,unusual,lethal,new,pentobarbital,final,lethal,such,pentobarbital,main,sedative,unavailable,due,sole,last,', ' relevant', ' lethal malicious sharp suspect unavailable unusual', 1, -6, -5, 7),

But these new concerns also reflect how troop levels in Afghanistan directly affect long-term U.S. security interests in neighbouring Pakistan, according to administration, military and intelligence officials.\n\n\nThe concern has become serious enough that the Obama administration has organised a team of intelligence, military and policy specialists to devise alternatives to mitigate the damage if a final security deal cannot be struck with the Afghan President, Hamid Karzai, who has declined to enact an agreement that U.S. officials thought was completed last year.\n\n\nIf Mr. Obama ultimately withdrew all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, the CIA&#8217;s drone bases in the country would have to be closed, according to administration officials, because they could no longer be protected.\n\n\nTheir concern is that the nearest alternative bases are too far away for drones to reach the mountainous territory in Pakistan where the remnants of al-Qaeda&#8217;s central command are hiding. Those bases would also be too distant to monitor and respond as quickly if there was a crisis involving missing nuclear material or weapons from the arsenals and related facilities in Pakistan and India.\n\n\nThe issue is coming to the fore after the Pentagon recently presented Mr. Obama with two options for the end of the year. One option calls for a presence through the end of Mr. Obama&#8217;s term of 10,000 U.S. troops who could train Afghan troops, conduct counterterrorism raids and protect the U.S. facilities, including those in eastern Afghanistan where drones and nuclear monitoring are based.\n\n\nUnder the other, zero option, no U.S. troops would remain.

The foetus was not delivered. \n\nThe hospital&#8217;s decision brought an apparent end to a case that inspired debates about abortion and end&#8212;of&#8212;life decisions, as well as whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a foetus, as per Texas law. Anti&#8212;abortion activists attended Friday&#8217;s court hearing and spoke out in favour of trying to deliver the foetus. \n\nWhether the Munoz case leads Texas to change the law remains unclear. In recent years, the Legislature has enacted several new anti&#8212;abortion restrictions, including setting the legal guideline for when a foetus can feel pain at 20 weeks, a milestone Marlise Munoz&#8217;s foetus passed about three weeks ago. \n\nMunoz&#8217;s husband, Erick Munoz, sued the hospital because it would not remove life support as he said his wife would have wanted in such a situation. The couple, both paramedics, was familiar with end&#8212;of&#8212;life issues, and Erick said his wife had told him she would not want to be kept alive under such circumstances. \n\nBut the hospital refused his request, citing Texas law that says life&#8212;sustaining treatment cannot be withdrawn from a pregnant patient, regardless of her end&#8212;of&#8212;life wishes. \n\nJudge R.H. Wallace sided Friday with Erick Munoz, saying in his order- &#8220;Mrs. Munoz is dead.&#8221; \n\nErick Munoz found his wife unconscious in their home on Nov. 26, possibly due to a blood clot.

Acting a month after he gave the Pentagon a year to show it had cut down on the number of sexual assaults within the military, \nMr. Obama summoned Cabinet officials and senior advisers to a White House meeting to review progress more broadly against rape and other sexual attacks, with the focus being on problems at college campuses. He then signed a presidential memorandum creating the task force, surrounded by advisers on his White House Council of Women and Girls. On Wednesday,it released a rundown of past and prospective administration actions titled &#8220;Rape and Sexual Assault: A Renewed Call to Action.&#8221; The issue is a priority of women&#8217;s groups, which have been crucial to Mr. Obama&#8217;s election victories. Although episodes of sexual assaults within the military have received more attention recently, rape is most common on campuses, the report said. One in five students has been assaulted, it said, but just 12 per cent of them report the violence.\nBecause many of the attacks occur at parties, victims are often &#8220;abused while they&#8217;re drunk, under the influence of drugs, passed out or otherwise incapacitated, the report said.\nAssailants are commonly serial offenders, it added, citing one study that found seven per cent of male students had admitted to committing or attempting rape, and nearly two-thirds of them said they had done so multiple times &#8212; six on average.\nFew of them are arrested or prosecuted, the report said, because victims do not report the crimes and because of police &#8220;biases&#8221; when reports are filed.\nAgainst this backdrop, Mr. Obama gave his task force 90 days to recommend best practices for colleges to prevent or respond to assaults, and to check that they are complying with existing legal obligations.\nThe task force &#8212; which includes the attorney general and the secretaries of the Education, Health and Human Services and Interior departments &#8212; was also asked for proposals to raise public awareness of colleges&#8217; records regarding assaults and officials&#8217; responses, and to see that federal agencies get involved when officials do not confront problems on their campuses.\nThe President said a priority was to find ways to encourage more men to intervene when they see an attack or to report assaults. &#8220;I want every young man in America to feel some strong peer pressure in terms of how they are supposed to behave and treat women,&#8221; Mr. Obama said.\nAt his side was Vice-President Joe Biden, who 20 years ago won passage of the Violence Against Women Act, which provided federal assistance for victims, health care professionals and law enforcement. Last year, the President signed a reauthorisation and an expansion of the law.\n&#8220;Our daughters, our sisters, our wives, our mothers, our grandmothers have every single right to expect to be free from violence and sexual abuse,&#8221; Mr. Biden said. &#8220;No matter what she&#8217;s wearing, no matter whether she&#8217;s in a bar, in a dormitory, in the back seat of a car, on a street, drunk or sober &#8212; no man has a right to go beyond the word &#8216;no&#8217;. And if she can&#8217;t consent, it also means no.&#8221;\n&#8220;Men have to take more responsibility.

It looks like the Chinese ghost will not go away. The Union Home Ministry has advised the Petroleum Ministry against considering Chinese firms for the award of exploration rights in oil and gas blocks due to &#8220;security reasons&#8221;. The on-land blocks in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab proposed for auction are located close to the border with Pakistan where apparently China is engaged in different projects. The blocks in the northeast and offshore ones in the Mahanadi basin, says the Home Ministry, are &#8220;close to sensitive defence installations and strategic assets&#8221;. In its view, these blocks should therefore be given only to Indian public sector companies for exploration. The Home Ministry also wants its advice to be kept in mind while finalising sub-contracts for services such as equipment procurement, consultancy and maintenance. Truth to tell, it is not as if too many foreign companies are lining up to invest in the country&#8217;s oil and gas exploration sector, not to talk of Chinese ones. The auctioning of oil exploration blocks under the New Exploration Licensing Policy has attracted but tepid attention from foreign bidders in the last couple of rounds, and the story is likely to be the same in the upcoming one as well.\n\n\nYet, the bogey of threat from Chinese companies needs to be busted. For all its exertions in recent years, the government has not provided concrete evidence of any wrongdoing by Chinese companies in the telecom and IT sectors. Its warnings have been based on mere suspicion &#8212; which is not enough grounds to keep out a foreign investor, especially in these difficult times for the economy. On the other hand, it was Facebook, Google and Twitter, companies that are headquartered in what is supposed to be a friendly country, which were in the eye of a storm over sharing data from their servers, including that of Indians, with the U.S. National Security Agency. This proves companies from friendly countries are as capable of aiding espionage as those from not-so-friendly ones. And the answer is not to ban or show the door to all multinationals but to put in place protective systems to safeguard the country&#8217;s interests and assets. In the case of the oil blocks there is indeed a problem as these are located in strategic or sensitive parts of the country. Instead of trying to keep out companies from one country or the other, the government would do well to create a reporting and monitoring system that will enable security agencies to keep an eye on the activities of these companies, especially when it comes to blocks located close to defence installations.

India is a country on the move.&#8221;\n\n\nHis comments come after weeks of intense diplomatic parleying culminated in Ms. Khobragade, whose strip-search in the custody of U.S. Marshals sparked outrage in India, being granted full diplomatic immunity by the State Department after her transfer to a new role in the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations was accepted.\n\n\nUnder cover of this immunity Ms. Khobragade was asked to leave the U.S. and she did so on January 9, 2014, however not before being indicted on two criminal charges, felonies relating to visa fraud and the alleged underpayment and overworking of her domestic employee Sangeeta Richard.\n\n\nWhile Ms. Richard is likely to receive a T-visa, usually given to victims of human trafficking, going forward, Ms. Khobragade will probably have an arrest warrant issued against her should she ever decide to return to the U.S. Her husband and two daughters, all U.S. citizens, remain in New York.\n\n\nEven as a cold frost gripped Washington there was a measure of warmth emanating from the State Department this week, however, and Mr. Kerry highlighted recent high-level meetings between the Indian and U.S. sides.\n\n\nHe said, &#8220;When I spoke with External Affairs Minister Khurshid in Montreaux this past week, we agreed that both our peoples benefit when the world&#8217;s largest and oldest democracies work closely together&#8230; and that our countries remain firmly committed to the indispensable U.S.-India partnership.&#8221;\n\n\nIndian Ambassador to the U.S., S. Jaishankar has also recently hinted at a post-Khobragade thaw in bilateral relations, yet indicated to media this week that there may be a push for greater clarity on interpretations of diplomatic and consular immunity, the principle that has been the focus of discussions since the senior diplomat&#8217;s arrest last month.\n', 'typical,annual,further,diplomatic,former,reflective,real,much,future,rich,first,intense,diplomatic,full,diplomatic,new,criminal,alleged,domestic,likely,human,recent,past,indispensable,bilateral,diplomatic,consular,senior,last,', ' diplomatic indispensable real rich', ' criminal', 4, -1, 3, 5);

It said the Palestinian men, two from Jerusalem and one from the West Bank, were recruited by an operative based in the Gaza Strip who worked for al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri. \n\nThe State Department said the U.S. was not yet able to corroborate the Israeli claims. \n\nWhile a number of groups inspired by al-Qaeda have carried out attacks against Israel before, this appeared to mark the first time an attack was directly planned by al-Qaeda leaders. \n\nThe Shin Bet said the Palestinians planned on attacking a Jerusalem conference centre with firearms and then kill rescue workers with a truck bomb. Al-Qaeda also planned to send foreign militants to attack the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv on the same day using explosives supplied by the Palestinians, it said. \n\nIt said five men whose identity and nationality were not disclosed were to fly into Israel with fake Russian passports to attack the American embassy. It was not clear where the men are located. \n\nThe Palestinian operatives had planned on several other attacks, it said. One included shooting out the tires of a bus and then gunning down passengers and ambulance workers. \n\nThe agency said it the plot was in &#8220;advanced planning stages&#8221; but gave no further information on how close the men got to carrying it out. It said the Palestinians from Jerusalem had used their Israeli resident cards to scope out and gather intelligence on targets. They were arrested in the past few weeks, it said. \n\nA number of al-Qaeda-inspired groups have carried out rocket attacks from Gaza and Egypt&#8217;s Sinai Peninsula, as well as shootings in the West Bank. Israeli intelligence calls these groups part of a &#8220;global jihad&#8221; movement. \n\nAviv Oreg, a former head of the Israeli military intelligence unit that tracks al-Qaeda, said the plot marked the first time it has been directly linked to an attempted attack in Israel. \n\n&#8220;This is the first time that Ayman al-Zawahri was directly involved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For them, it would have been a great achievement.&#8221; \n\nThe Shin Bet said the three suspects made contact with al-Qaeda over the Internet. It said they planned on travelling to Syria where various jihadist groups are battling the forces of President Bashar Assad for training. \n\nMr. Oreg said that many foreign fighters fighting the Assad regime are from Chechnya and predominantly Muslim parts of Russia and speculated that the militants with the phony documents would be from there. \n\nAl-Zawahri&#8217;s location is unknown, but he was last believed to be in Pakistan. He is the subject of an intense manhunt and is not believed to personally go online or pick up the phone to discuss terror plots, experts say. \n\nLast year, a threat that began with a message from the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to al-Zawahri led to the closures of embassies across the Middle East and Africa, a U.S. official said at the time. The message essentially sought out al-Zawahri&#8217;s blessing to launch attacks. \n\nAl-Qaeda-inspired groups are on the rise in the Gaza Strip, which is run by the Islamic militant Hamas. \n\nThese groups accuse Hamas of being too lenient because it has observed cease-fires with Israel and has stopped short of imposing Islamic religious law, or Shariah, in Gaza. \n\nIn the West Bank, Israel and the Palestinian Authority of Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have cracked down on Islamic militants. Three Salafis, members of a movement that advocates a hard-line interpretation of Islamic law, were killed in a shootout with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank last November. \n\nIn Washington, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said U.S. investigators and intelligence officials were not yet able to corroborate the Israeli information and declined comment on specifics of the case. \n\n&#8220;Obviously we&#8217;re looking into it as well,&#8221; Mr. Harf told reporters Wednesday. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have reason to believe it&#8217;s not true.

It said parts of New York City had 10 inches (25 cm). \n\nThe snow came down harder and faster than many people expected. A blizzard warning was posted for parts of Massachusetts, including Cape Cod. \n\nParts of the northeastern New England States saw initial light snowfalls turn heavier as the night wore on. Foxboro, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island, each received about 11 inches (28 cm) of snow, and Stamford, Connecticut, got 9 inches (23 cm). Forecasters said the storm could be followed by bitter cold as arctic air from Canada streams in. \n\nIn Maryland,the storm was blamed for at least one death in the state, that of a driver whose car fishtailed into the path of a tractor-trailer on a snow-covered road 80 km northwest of Baltimore. And police said the storm might have claimed more lives: A preliminary investigation showed wet conditions played a role in a two-vehicle crash that killed two people in Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland. \n\nThe storm was a conventional one that developed off the coast and moved its way up the Eastern Seaboard, pulling in cold air from the arctic. Unlike the epic freeze of two weeks ago, it wasn&#8217;t caused by a kink in the polar vortex, the winds that circulate around the North Pole. \n\nThis second fierce blast of winter weather is sapping fuel supplies in many regions in the U.S. and sending prices for propane and natural gas to record highs. \n\nCustomers who heat with natural gas or electricity probably won&#8217;t see dramatically higher prices, in part because utilities typically buy their fuel under longer-term contracts at set prices. But propane customers who find themselves suddenly needing to fill their tanks could be paying $100 to $200 more per fill-up than they did a month ago. \n\nAbout 3,000 flights for Tuesday were cancelled, with airports from Washington to Boston affected. More than 1,000 flights for Wednesday were called off as well. Amtrak planned to cut back passenger train service. \n\nThe rush to get home early by many workers was evident in Philadelphia, where many commuter trains were packed. \n\nThe storm put a damper on New Jersey Governor Chris Christie&#8217;s inauguration, forcing the cancellation of an evening party. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick postponed his annual State of the State address, and the Philadelphia Flyers postponed their Tuesday night ice hockey game. \n\nSchools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky stayed closed for an extra day after the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday or sent students home early. \n\nFederal workers in the Washington area also were given the day off.

The day before that date the State Department granted Ms. Khobragade full diplomatic immunity thus completing her transfer to the PMI-UN.\nImmediately, and as per past precedent, the U.S. asked India to waive this immunity in order to take forward the criminal charges she faced, for visa fraud and causing false statements to be made to obtain an A-3 visa for Ms. Richard.\nIndia refused to comply, as its priority at that point was to get Ms. Khobragade out of the country and safe from the prospect of being re-arrested and face trial.\nWhile attention has since that point settled around other Indian diplomats in the U.S., by some reports 14 of them, who have brought in domestic workers on A-3 or G-5 visas, the MEA is said to be considering restructuring their employment contract such that they are directly employed by the Government of India rather than the diplomat in questions.\nWhile this would in all probability remove the issue from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, it has not yet happened and in any case the U.S.&#8217; suspension of visa issuance would represent the closing of a door.\nIn addition the bill passed by Mr. Obama requires Mr. Kerry to assist in obtaining payment of final court judgments awarded to A&#8211;3 and G&#8211;5 visa holders, including encouraging the sending states to provide compensation directly to victims.\nThis proviso, along with the clause on default judgements, may apply in the case of another New York-based Indian diplomat, Neena Malhotra, who faced similar charges under a civil case and ultimately was slapped with a $1.5 million fine by a U.S. judge in 2012, even while she was in India.\nLastly Mr. Kerry is, under the spending bill, required to include a &#8220;concise summary&#8221; of each trafficking case meeting the criteria outlined in the annual &#8216;Trafficking in Persons&#8217; report, all potentially designed to signal the U.S.&#8217; seriousness of purpose in pursuing such cases.\nThe bill provisions in this regard draw strength from the clause of the anti-trafficking Act which authorises domestic worker visa suspension to diplomats if the Secretary of State finds sufficient evidence that &#8220;one or more employees of such a mission&#8230; have abused or exploited one or more non-immigrants&#8230; and that the diplomatic mission&#8230; tolerated such actions.&#8221;', 'last,federal,conditional,preliminary,notable,key,domestic,Indian,domestic,due,minimum,legal,former,subsequent,diplomatic,diplomatic,certain,last,domestic,further,final,current,former,diplomatic,national,important,individual,criminal,third,full,diplomatic,criminal,other,Indian,domestic,such,closing,final,similar,civil,annual,signal,such,domestic,such,diplomatic,such,', ' civil diplomatic important notable', ' criminal', 4, -1, 3, 5),

We have to design economic systems that build in checks and balances and that are inherently transparent,&#8221; he said. \nThe impact of corruption in India cannot, however, be underestimated. The telecom scam and the coal scam, for instance, have dented people&#8217;s confidence in the government. &#8220;But solving corruption does not necessarily lead to economic growth.&#8221;\nIt is ironic, said Prof. Stiglitz, that although the American-style capitalism is clearly not working, with clearly widening inequality, &#8220;this is what the world emulates&#8221;. The U.S.&#8217;s growth story has been &#8220;anti-poor and anti-middleclass,&#8221; Prof. Stiglitz said.\n&#8220;The view that privatisation will increase efficiency has been discredited. Trickle-down economies have been discredited, neo-liberal policies have been discredited, and the 2008 crisis was empirical validation of this,&#8221; said Prof. Stiglitz. \n&#8220;Bill Gates is doing well but that doesn&#8217;t mean the United State of America is.

If there was to be any reconciliation, the Pakistanis intended to control it,&#8221; Mr. Gates said.\n\n\nIn his memoir running into more than 600 pages, Mr. Gates says weeks before his inauguration, Mr. Obama asked him to travel to Chicago to attend a meeting of his transition&#8217;s national security team, which among others was attended by Ms. Hillary Clinton and Mr. Joe Biden.\n\n\nThe meeting, held in December, spent nearly an hour discussing on Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, Mr. Gates writes.\n\n\n&#8220;Pakistan was described as the biggest, most dangerous situation,&#8221; he writes.\n\n\nIn Mach 2009, Mr. Gates writes, Mr. Obama held a series of meetings on his Af-Pak to discuss report of Bruce Riedel, who was appointed by the President. One of those Friday, he writes, they reviewed the final Riedel report.\n\n\nThis &#8220;recommended disrupting the terrorist networks in Afghanistan and especially Pakistan, promoting a more effective government in Afghanistan, developing the Afghan security forces, ending Pakistan&#8217;s support for terrorist and insurgent groups, enhancing civilian control in Pakistan, and using US diplomatic, military, and intelligence channels to reduce enmity and distrust between Pakistan and India. It was breathtaking in its ambition,&#8221; Mr. Gates writes.\n\n\nWhen Obama announced his Af-Pak strategy, Mr. Gates said he had reservations on Pakistan&#8217;s co-operation.\n\n\n&#8220;I also doubted we could persuade the Pakistanis to change their &#8216;calculus&#8217; and go after the Afghan and other extremists on their side of the border. When a Pakistani Taliban offensive that spring reached within sixty miles of Islamabad the Pakistani army went after them in the border provinces of Swat and South Waziristan for their own protection.\n\n\n&#8220;Their continuing toleration of the Afghan Taliban, including harbouring their leaders in Quetta was a hedging strategy based on their lack of trust in us, given unwillingness to stay engaged in Afghanistan in the early 1990s,&#8221; he writes.\n\n\nSuch was his distrust of Pakistan that, he writes, when they were planning for Osama bin Laden raid, he was worried that the ISI was aware of the al-Qaeda chief&#8217;s whereabouts.\n\n\n&#8220;I worried that Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence was aware of where Bin Laden was and that there might be rings of security around the compound that we knew nothing about or, at minimum, that 1ST might have more eyes on the compound than we could know,&#8221; he wrote.\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario was that the Pakistanis could get a number of troops to the compound quickly, prevent extraction of our team and take them prisoner, he writes.\n\n\nWhen he asked his Vice Admiral William McRaven what he planned to do if the Pakistani military showed up during the operation, he said the team would just hunker down and wait for a &#8220;diplomatic extraction.&#8221;\n\n\n&#8220;They would wait inside the compound and not shoot any Pakistanis. I then asked what they would do if the Pakistanis breached the walls: &#8216;Do you shoot or surrender?&#8217; Our team couldn&#8217;t surrender, I said. If the Pakistani military showed up, our team needed to be prepared to do whatever was necessary to escape,&#8221; Mr. Gates writes.\n\n\n&#8220;After considerable discussion, there was broad agreement to this, and as a result, additional MH-47 helicopters and forces were assigned to the mission,&#8221; he says.\n\n\nMr. Gates writes that ahead of the Abbottabad raid no one inside the administration talked about seeking Pakistani help in killing bin Laden.\n\n\n&#8220;No one thought we should ask the Pakistanis for help or permission. In every instance when we had provided a heads-up to the Pakistan military or intelligence services, the target was forewarned and fled, or the Pakistanis went after the target unilaterally, prematurely and unsuccessfully,&#8221; he says.\n\n\nThe successful bin Laden raid, he writes, was humiliating for the Pakistan Army.\n', 'former,second,last,senior,consistent,safe,next,such,profitable,same,sanctuary,other,top,national,dangerous,final,effective,civilian,diplomatic,military,distrust,other,offensive,own,early,aware,aware,minimum,military,inside,military,necessary,considerable,broad,additional,military,successful,', ' broad consistent diplomatic effective necessary profitable safe sanctuary successful top', ' dangerous offensive', 10, -2, 8, 12),

Both India and Ms. Khobragade have refuted the charges.\n\n\nThe action plan, released at a White House event by Cecilia Munoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council, stated: &#8220;Department of State will develop procedures for the in-person registration of domestic workers employed by diplomatic personnel in the Washington DC area shortly after their arrival in the U.S. to apprise them further of their rights and available services.&#8221; \n\nHowever, it did not mention anything about in-person registration of foreign domestic workers in cities like New York, where a significantly large number of diplomats are posted.\n\n\nRunning into 80 pages, the document said the State Department will continue to address the protection of A-3 and G-5 workers through its regular internal working group meetings on domestic worker issues, which reviews allegations and cases, and discusses strategies and ongoing efforts to prevent abuse and ensure compliance with its requirements.\n\n\nA-3 and G-5 visas are for foreign domestic workers who come to the U.S. with diplomats or foreign officials who work with international bodies like the UN, World Bank and International Monetary Fund. \n\nThe State Department will continue to streamline referrals of potential victims to its Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which coordinates with the Department of Justice and other agencies to investigate allegations of abuse.\n\n\nAccording to the document, the State Department will continue to brief stakeholders annually, including NGOs, to raise awareness about efforts to protect and identify victims of trafficking.\n\n\nThe Bureau of Consular Affairs, with assistance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, will develop a &#8220;Know Your Rights&#8221; video to provide information on protections for certain employment- and education-based non-immigrant visa applicants, including domestic workers.\n\n\nRecognising the vulnerabilities inherent in domestic work and the need to foreclose avenues of exploitation, particularly of those employed by diplomats, the State Department will continue its efforts to educate foreign mission personnel and their domestic workers about U.S. federal, State, and local laws, including protections for domestic workers employed by diplomatic personnel.\n\n\nThe document said the Bureau of Diplomatic Security will create an online human trafficking investigation education course that includes instructions on how to identify and treat potential trafficking victims, the best practices to successfully investigate and prosecute trafficking offences, and how to refer victims for services.\n\n\nMunoz said the five-year plan lays out a path for increased coordination, collaboration, and capacity across the federal government and in partnership with other governmental and nongovernmental entities at all levels.\n\n\n&#8220;It describes the steps that federal agencies will take to ensure that all victims of human trafficking in the United States are identified and have access to the services they need to recover and to rebuild their lives.\n\n\n&#8220;This includes a victim services network that is comprehensive, trauma-informed, and responsive to the needs of all victims, regardless of the type of trafficking they endured, and regardless of race, colour, national origin, disability, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or immigration status,&#8221; Ms. Munoz said.\n', 'domestic,foreign,mandatory,apparent,alleged,domestic,alleged,domestic,former,domestic,diplomatic,available,foreign,domestic,large,regular,internal,domestic,foreign,domestic,foreign,international,potential,other,brief,certain,domestic,inherent,domestic,foreign,domestic,federal,local,domestic,diplomatic,potential,federal,other,governmental,nongovernmental,federal,human,comprehensive,responsive,national,sexual,', ' comprehensive diplomatic large potential responsive', '', 5, 0, 5, 5),

He declined to name the buyer. \n\nThe Safari Club&#8217;s executive director, Ben Carter, has defended the auction, saying all money raised will go toward protecting the species. He also said the rhino that the winner will be allowed to hunt is old, male and nonbreeding and that the animal was likely to be targeted for removal anyway because it was becoming aggressive and threatening other wildlife. \n\nBut the auction drew howls from critics, including wildlife and animal rights groups, and the FBI said it was investigating death threats against members of the club. \n\nOfficials from the Humane Society and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have said that while culling can be appropriate in abundant animal populations, all black rhinos should be protected, given their endangered status. \n\nAn estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 are in Namibia, according to the Safari Club. \n\nCritics have also said any hunting of a rhino sends a bad message to the public. \n\n&#8220;This auction is telling the world that an American will pay anything to kill their species,&#8221; Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director of the Massachusetts&#8212;based IFAW, said this past week. &#8220;This is, in fact, making a spectacle of killing an endangered species.&#8221; \n\nThe auction took place in downtown Dallas under tight security. Organizers hoped to at least break the previous high bid for one of the permits in Namibia, which was $223,000, and had said the amount could be as high as $1 million. The nation offers five permits each year, and the one auctioned on Saturday was the first to be made available for purchase outside of Namibia. \n\nThe winning bidder could have come from anywhere in the world, and at least some bidders were expected to enter by phone. \n\nAbout 40 protesters gathered early Saturday evening outside the convention center where the auction and a pre&#8212;auction dinner were to take place. They held signs and chanted. Most dispersed by just after 6 p.m. CST. \n\nJim and Lauren Ries traveled with their children from Atlanta to protest the auction of the rare black rhino hunting permit in Dallas. Jim Ries said it was his son Carter (12), and daughter Olivia (11), who pushed for them to go and participate. \n\nJim Ries said his children are passionate about animal conservation and were working to help adopt cheetahs in Africa. The family started a nonprofit called One More Generation, dedicated to saving endangered species. \n\n&#8220;There&#8217;s less than 5,000 black rhinos left on the planet,&#8221; the father said, &#8220;and if our kids ever want to see a rhino left in the wild, we can&#8217;t be pulling the trigger on every one we say is too old to breed.&#8221; \n\nPoachers long have targeted all species of rhino, primarily for its horn, which is valuable on the international black market.

It shouldn&#8217;t take too long to thaw out, though. The forecast Wednesday was sunny and 42 degrees (5 Celsius). \n\nIn the Midwest and East, where brutal polar air has lingered over the past few days, temperatures climbed but were still expected to be below freezing. \n\nIn Indianapolis, Timolyn Johnson&#8212;Fitzgerald returned to her home after spending the night in a shelter with her three children because they lost power to their apartment.

At least five people died after collapsing while shoveling snow, while several victims were identified as homeless people who either refused shelter or didn&#8217;t make it to a warm haven soon enough. \n\nIn Missouri on Monday, a 1&#8212;year&#8212;old boy was killed when the car he was riding in struck a snow plow, and a 20&#8212;year&#8212;old woman was killed in a separate crash after her car slid on ice and into the path of a tractor&#8212;trailer. \n\nIn a phenomenon that forecasters said is actually not all that unusual, all 50 states saw freezing temperatures at some point Tuesday.

The icy air covered about half the country by Tuesday, but it was moving north, returning more normal and warmer weather to most of the country. \n\nThe deep freeze dragged on in the Midwest.

Many economists think Ms. Yellen&#8217;s big challenge will be deciding how to ease off some of those very policies, which Mr. Bernanke took with her support. \n\n&#8220;Circumstances may demand more rapid tightening than people are expecting,&#8221; said Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services, who envisions a growing economy this year. He contrasted that with Mr. Bernanke, who he said had to decide &#8220;when to step on the gas pedal and how hard&#8221; as the economy recovered weakly from the recession. \n\nThe Senate confirmed Ms. Yellen, a long-time Fed official and economist at the University of California at Berkeley, by a 56&#8212;26 vote on Monday. Supporting her were all 45 voting Democrats and 11 Republicans, while all opposing votes came from the GOP. Many senators missed the vote because frigid weather canceled numerous airline flights. \n\nMs. Yellen begins her four-year term on Feb. 1, when Mr. Bernanke steps down. She has been Fed vice chair since 2010. \n\nNominated by President Barack Obama to the top job in October, Ms. Yellen comes to the post after a career in which she has focused in part on unemployment and its causes. Obama and congressional Democrats lauded her concerns for workers on Monday. \n\nIn a written statement, Mr. Obama said Ms. Yellen&#8217;s approval means &#8220;the American people will have a fierce champion who understands that the ultimate goal of economic and financial policymaking is to improve the lives, jobs and standard of living of American workers and their families.&#8221; \n\nMany Republicans were less enthusiastic. Sen. Charles Grassley warned that a continuation of the Fed&#8217;s easy money policies &#8220;risks fueling an economic bubble and even hyper-inflation,&#8221; which he said could cause &#8220;real and lasting damage to our economy.&#8221; \n\nLobbyists for the banking and financial services sectors issued statements pledging to work with Ms. Yellen. Both industries have led a fight to water down restrictions imposed by Mr. Obama&#8217;s 2010 law overhauling how the nation&#8217;s financial system is regulated. \n\nThe Fed announced in December that the labour market has improved enough that it will begin reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, starting with a $10 billion reduction this month. It has pushed that money into the economy to try keeping long-term interest rates low. \n\nBut Ms. Yellen will face questions about how to manage that process. Moving too fast could spook financial markets and shove interest rates higher, while withdrawing the bonds too slowly could risk creating bubbles that might burst in real estate, the stock market or other assets. \n\nThe bond purchases have ballooned the Fed&#8217;s holdings over $4 trillion. That leaves Ms. Yellen with decisions about how to wind down the central bank&#8217;s balance sheet to a smaller, more normal level without destabilizing financial markets used to the huge cash infusions. \n\nMs. Yellen also will have to decide when and how to ease off short-term interest rates, which the Fed has kept near zero since December 2008. To assure investors that those rates won&#8217;t precipitously rise, the Fed has repeatedly issued statements saying that policy will continue. \n\nLast month, the Fed said the low rates will continue &#8220;well past&#8221; when the unemployment rates falls to 6.5 percent. Unemployment was 7 percent in November and many economists think the low interest rates will last until late 2015. \n\nMs. Yellen will also guide the Fed at a time when some Republicans say the central bank needs to be more accountable to Congress. Last week, Mr. Bernanke voiced concerns about legislation giving the Government Accountability Office, Congress&#8217; auditing arm, more power to examine how the Fed makes interest rate decisions. Mr. Bernanke said such legislation would make it harder to assure markets that its decisions aren&#8217;t influenced by political pressure.\n', 'different,economic,different,big,rapid,frigid,numerous,top,congressional,ultimate,economic,financial,standard,American,easy,economic,bubble,lasting,financial,financial,monthly,financial,real,other,central,normal,financial,huge,low,many,low,late,central,accountable,such,political,', ' easy normal real top ultimate', ' accountable frigid low', 5, -3, 2, 8),

For a vast majority of Crimea&#8217;s Russian-speaking population this is an act of redressing a monumental injustice that happened in 1991 when Crimea, which geographically, ethnically and historically is more Russian than many regions of Russia itself, became part of a foreign state as the Soviet Union broke up along arbitrarily drawn administrative borders.\n\n\nHowever, reuniting a divided people may not have been the prime motive that forced President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s hand in Crimea. The Ukraine crisis is viewed in Moscow as a continuation of the Western plan to encircle Russia militarily and torpedo its reintegration efforts in the former Soviet Union.\n\n\nThe new leaders in Kiev installed with the West&#8217;s support are the same people who staged the &#8220;orange revolution&#8221; in Ukraine in 2004 and set Ukraine on the path of NATO membership.\n\n\n<b>Strategic catastrophe\n</b>\n\nUkraine&#8217;s induction into NATO would be a strategic catastrophe for Russia. NATO would come within 425 kilometres of Moscow, cut off Russia from the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and squeeze it out of the Caucasus.\n\n\nConservative Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, whose ideas of Russia&#8217;s Eurasianism as opposed to Western ultra-liberalism increasingly resonate in the Kremlin, views the current upheaval in Ukraine as &#8220;the battle of the unipolar world of U.S. hegemony against Russia.&#8221;\n\n\n&#8220;Whereas in Libya we shunned the battle, because we had [President Dmitry] Medvedev at the helm, in Syria and Ukraine we have taken up the gauntlet,&#8221; Prof. Dugin wrote last month.\n\n\nIn Ukraine, Mr. Putin made the same point he has been driving home in Syria: regime change by force is illegal. When Western nations hailed the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Ukraine as &#8220;a democratic free choice of the Ukrainian people,&#8221; Mr. Putin&#8217;s reply was: Crimea also has the right to make its own free choice.\n\n\nThe West pushed Mr. Putin too far in Ukraine, which is more than just a former Soviet state. It is where the Russian nation was born &#8212; in medieval &#8220;Kievan Rus&#8221; &#8212; and it is still part of the &#8220;Russian world.&#8221; The West&#8217;s efforts to bring Ukraine into its orbit were viewed in Moscow as an encroachment on Russia itself.\n\n\n&#8220;For Russia, it is not just a red line; it&#8217;s a solid double red line that no one is permitted to cross,&#8221; said Fyodor Lukyanov, Chairman of Russia&#8217;s authoritative Council on Foreign and Defence Policy.\n\n\nUkraine, the second most powerful economy in the former Soviet Union, is a linchpin to Mr. Putin&#8217;s plan to build the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), a Moscow-led version of the European Union. The U.S. denounced the plan as a disguised attempt to re-create the Soviet Union and vowed to disrupt it.\n\n\n&#8220;There is a move to re-Sovietize the region,&#8221; Hillary Clinton said in 2012, when she was still U.S. Secretary of State. &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be called that. It&#8217;s going to be called a Customs Union, it will be called Eurasian Union and all of that.&#8221; \n\n&#8220;But let&#8217;s make no mistake about it,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We know what the goal is and we are trying to figure out effective ways to slow down or prevent it.&#8221;\n\n\nAn &#8220;effective way&#8221; to wreck Mr. Putin&#8217;s project was found when the European Union offered Ukraine an &#8220;either-or&#8221; choice between closer ties with Europe or membership in Mr. Putin&#8217;s EEU. As former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote years ago, &#8220;Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire in Eurasia.&#8221;\n\n\nMr. Yanukovych used the E.U. talks for a free trade and association pact in order to play Europe against Russia in an attempt to get the best deals from both sides, but overplayed his hand. When he scuttled the E.U. pact last November in favour of a multi-billion Russian aid package, Ukrainians felt robbed of their hopes for prosperous life in affluent Europe. It was an illusion assiduously nurtured by Western politicians and the media, but Mr. Yanukovych&#8217;s turnaround triggered mass protests that eventually brought down his kleptocratic and inept regime.\n\n\nApart from geopolitical compulsions, Moscow&#8217;s support for Crimea&#8217;s breakaway bid was driven by important domestic considerations. The protests in Ukraine, manipulated as they were by the West, reflected the rise of grass-root civic activity against corruption and authoritarianism &#8212; the same problems that bedevil Russia and that brought thousands of anti-government protesters onto the streets of Moscow two years ago. By intervening in Ukraine, Mr. Putin sought to stop the surging pro-democracy wave from spilling over to Russia.\n\n\nMr Putin is widely expected to seek a fourth presidential term in 2018. However, the protest rallies against his return to presidency in 2012 were a sign of growing wariness with his rule. A poll conducted by the respected Levada Centre last year found that half of Russians would like to see a new leader in 2018. A multi-thousand-strong rally in Moscow at the weekend showed that anti-Putin sentiments are still strong among West-oriented urbanites.\n\n\nHowever, overall, Russians support Mr. Putin&#8217;s policy on Crimea&#8217;s reunification. A March survey showed that Mr. Putin&#8217;s approval ratings rose by 10 per cent in one month and were at the highest level in years.\n\n\nExperts said Mr. Putin needs a new agenda to retain voter support &#8212; reassembly of lost Russian lands. &#8220;Putin has exhausted the limit of people&#8217;s gratitude for having saved the country from chaos and ruin,&#8221; said Prof. Dugin. &#8220;He needs a new future-oriented strategy to re-establish his legitimacy. Eurasian integration of the former Soviet space would give him such strategy.&#8221;\n\n\n<b>Serious risks</b><br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Putin&#8217;s intervention in Ukraine has brought Russia strategic gains but is fraught with serious risks.\n\n\nCrimea&#8217;s reunification with Russia solves the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which Ukraine&#8217;s new leaders vowed to shut down and for which there is no other basing location that does not freeze in winter. Russia retains strategic grip on the region and ability to project its naval power to the Mediterranean and beyond.\n\n\nThe Ukraine and Western powers said they would not recognise Crimea&#8217;s split from Ukraine, but Russia argued that Kosovo&#8217;s self-proclaimed independence from Serbia provided legitimate precedent. Moscow recalled the 2010 ruling by the U.N. International Court of Justice, which said that unilateral declaration of independence by a part of a country did not violate international law.\n\n\nThe example of Crimea has inspired other Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine to demand greater powers from the centre. If Ukraine switches from a unitary state to a federation, the pro-Russia regions will get the right to block any sharp swing of the country towards the West.\n\n\nAt the same time there is a risk of Ukraine sinking into chaos. Mr. Yanukovych&#8217;s downfall left Ukraine in shatters. The country is bankrupt and heading for default. The new authorities&#8217; shaky grip on power may weaken further as they embark on harsh austerity measures to qualify for urgent assistance from the International Monetary Fund and Western governments.\n\n\nThe rise of far right and neo-Nazi groups, who spearheaded deadly clashes in Kiev last month, widened the chasm between Ukraine&#8217;s pro-Russia southeast and nationalist west. If Ukraine breaks up along the east-west divide, its western part will join NATO. This would be a dubious victory for Russia.\n\n\nRussia&#8217;s relations with the West are fast deteriorating, but how far they will slide back is an open question. &#8220;The West and Russia have sailed into uncharted waters,&#8221; said Dmitry Trenin, head of the Carnegie Moscow Centre.\n\n\nThe analyst predicted that U.S.-Russia geopolitical rivalry will intensify and affect their collaboration on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan. &#8220;Although the static military confrontation is unlikely to be resurrected, nuclear deterrence will be reaffirmed, and competition in the military sphere will spread to other areas, from cyberspace to conventional prompt global strike,&#8221; Mr. Trenin wrote in <i>Foreign Policy</i>.\n\n\nEconomic sanctions the U.S. and Europe threaten to impose against Russia will push it further towards China, experts said.

He noted that Vice President Joe Biden would be travelling to Europe late Monday to reassure Eastern European leaders of America&#8217;s commitment to them and that he himself would be going next week on a previously planned trip to make a similar point. Secretary of State John Kerry also is expected in Europe in the coming days. \n\n&#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continued Russian military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia&#8217;s diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russian economy.&#8221;\n\n\n<b>Putin recognises Crimea</b>\n\n\nBut administration critics said Mr. Obama&#8217;s actions were too little to convince Mr. Putin of anything. &#8220;I think Vladimir Putin must be encouraged by the absolute timidity,&#8221; said Republican Sen.

Mr. Putin maintains that the vote was legal and consistent with the right of self-determination.\n\n\nThe U.S. announcement of sanctions came shortly after the European Union (EU) announced travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people the EU has linked to the unrest in Crimea. U.S. officials say there is some overlap between the U.S. list and that of the Europeans, which wasn&#8217;t immediately made public.\n\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets the targeted individuals have under U.S. jurisdiction, make it illegal for Americans to do business with them and discourage international banks and financial institutions from having relationships with them, administration officials said.

On available figures, almost 97 per cent of those who voted favoured unification with Russia; the option of the <i>status quo </i>was not offered, and the Crimean government, headed by Sergey Aksyonov, promptly voted to approve the plan. In the Ukrainian capital Kiev, interim Prime Minister Oleksandr Turchynov rejected the referendum as unconstitutional, but he was powerless to prevent it. The proximate cause of the referendum was the then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych&#8217;s unannounced departure from office on February 22, following weeks of public protests &#8211; and a violent government crackdown &#8212; over revelations of his corruption and his abrogation of an association agreement with the EU, which may well have led to Ukraine&#8217;s joining the EU in due course. In response, Russia, which had offered Kiev a &#8364;15-billion aid package and retains a naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea, sent troops into the 58 per cent ethnic-Russian province, where Mr. Aksyonov had already been voted into the regional prime ministership while armed guards kept all but his own party out of the Assembly building in Simferopol. \n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin considers Mr. Yanukovych the victim of a West-inspired <i>coup d&#8217;Ã©tat</i>, but the issues are much wider. The EU deal would have involved Ukraine in IMF restructuring and much closer cooperation with NATO-dominated EU defence institutions. Moscow saw this as a threat, especially following the emergence of evidence that U.S. troops had helped prime Georgian weapons in the latter&#8217;s 2008 attempt to seize South Ossetia; Russian governments also recall the unilateral U.S. recognition of Kosovo in 2008, and Mr. Putin was incensed when plans emerged for Ukraine to join NATO. Moreover, ethnic Russians in Crimea were not consulted over then Soviet President Nikita Khruschev&#8217;s decision to hand over the province to Ukraine in 1954. Tensions within Ukraine were further exacerbated by Mr. Turchynov&#8217;s appointment of several far-right politicians to senior ministerial posts in Kiev, and by a new law ending the official status of the Russian language in Crimea. The U.S. and the EU are considering sanctions, such as visa bans and asset freezes, against Russian officials; the G7 countries have declared the Crimea referendum illegal, but no Western bloc may be able to stop the dismemberment of Ukraine and prevent the start of a new Cold War. \n\n<b>Correction and Clarification</b>\n\n\n<i>&gt;&gt;&#8220;<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-new-cold-war/article5797139.ece" target="_blank">The new Cold War</a>&#8221; (Editorial, March 18, 2014) erroneously attributed to Mikhail Gorbachev the decision to hand over Crimea to Ukraine when the USSR collapsed in 1991.

(220, '1979', 'March 14, 2014', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-many-shades-of-grey-in-ukraine/article5781594.ece', '\nWhen is an invasion not an invasion? When is sovereignty not sovereignty? When is an unelected regime more legitimate than an elected government? The answer, it seems, is when we are discussing Ukraine. The crisis in Ukraine has swiftly turned into a global stand-off. It has also become the focus for a war of words about the meaning of freedom, democracy, legitimacy and sovereignty.\n\n\nFor many in the West, Russia&#8217;s operations in Crimea bear comparison to Hitler&#8217;s annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938. Others fear that Vladimir Putin is launching a new Cold War. Russian commentators, in the meantime, accuse the West of helping overthrow an elected government in the Ukraine, and of supporting a fascist putsch.\n\n\nWhat is rarely acknowledged in this war of words is that the conflict in Ukraine is far messier than how many wish to paint it. Consider, for instance, three of the key questions that lie at the heart the struggle in Ukraine.\n\n\n<b>Revolution or coup?</b>\n\n\nWere the events in Kiev that led to the crisis a revolution or a coup?\n\n\nMany Western commentators see the protests that led to the overthrowing of President Viktor Yanukovich as a revolution. Russian commentators view it as a fascist coup. Neither is the case.\n\n\nMr. Yanukovich&#8217;s government was corrupt, authoritarian and brutal. It was also democratically elected. The fact that Mr. Yanukovich was democratically elected does not mean that he should not have been challenged outside of the ballot box. Democracy is not just about placing a cross on a ballot paper. It is also about the creation of a robust public sphere, of a polity that is contested as much in the streets and the workplaces as in the polling station.\n\n\nThe protests against Mr. Yanukovich that erupted in Kiev&#8217;s Maidan, or Independence Square, and that eventually led to his downfall, were as much part of the democratic process as was the election of the President in the first place. They were expressions of popular unrest, no different to the mass protests against President Mohammed Morsy that engulfed Egypt last year. But the weakness of Ukraine&#8217;s liberal opposition allowed the far right to take a leading role, just as in Egypt a similar weakness of liberal organisation put the military in the driving seat. The street thugs of Pravy Sektor or &#8216;Right Sector&#8217; &#8212; a collection of hardcore neo-Nazi groups &#8212; were particularly prominent. In normal circumstances Western commentators would have denounced their presence on the streets of Kiev; because they played a useful role in the overthrow of Mr. Yanukovich, the fascists thugs have been accepted with a shrug.\n\n\nIf the protests were, at least partly, progressive and democratic, the regime that has replaced the Yanukovich government is neither. It was put together largely by the Foreign Ministers of Germany, Poland and France who helped organise the negotiations between Mr. Yanukovich and the opposition.\n\n\nThe new government has shown itself to be as authoritarian as the old one. One of its first acts was to deny regions the right to give official status to languages other than Ukrainian. The prospective law was eventually vetoed by the interim President; it was, nevertheless, a hugely symbolic move in a nation in which 40 per cent of the population speaks Russian, and another 5 per cent other non-Ukraine languages.\n\n\nWhile the overthrow of Mr. Yanukovich was clearly no fascist putsch, the new government is, nevertheless, disproportionately influenced by the far right. Representatives of two neo-fascist parties, Svoboda and Right Sector, now occupy seven ministerial posts, including that of Deputy Prime Minister and national security. Svoboda is a party that traces its roots to a Second World War partisan army allied to the Nazis and is part of the far-right Alliance of European National Movements, whose members include the British National Party (BNP); Jobbik, Hungary&#8217;s neo-fascist, anti-Semitic party; and the French Front National. Svoboda leader Oleh Tyahnybok has denounced in Parliament the &#8216;Muscovite-Jewish mafia&#8217; that he claims controls Ukraine.\n\n\nAll of Ukraine&#8217;s fascists are not simply on one side. The pro-Russian side has been pouring out anti-Semitic propaganda, claiming that the protest leaders are all Jews, and that if European liberalism gains sway, their children would be &#8216;turned gay&#8217;. What is particularly troubling, though, is that those who support the supposedly progressive, pro-European cause can acquiesce so easily to the presence of fascists in their midst.\n\n\n<b>Referendum in Crimea</b>\n\n\nShould Crimea be allowed to secede from Ukraine?\n\n\nRussia insists that the coming referendum in Crimea to determine whether or not it wishes to join the Russian federation is an expression of democracy and self-determination. Western commentators condemn it as an illegal vote contrary to international law and the Ukrainian Constitution.\n\n\nThe referendum takes place against the background of what is effectively a Russian invasion of Crimea. The presence of Russian forces and government control of the media make unlikely the possibility of a clean vote.\n\n\nThe break-up of Ukraine would be potentially disastrous, threatening bloody sectarian violence and entrenching ethnic animosities. Many groups in Crimea, Muslim Tartars in particular, are rightly fearful of the Russian embrace. Yet, the Western condemnations of the Crimean referendum miss the point. It ill-behoves governments that recently helped circumvent the Ukrainian Constitution to get rid of Viktor Yanukovich and install an unelected government to dismiss the referendum as &#8216;unconstitutional&#8217;. Nor does it help that those Western powers now insisting on the &#8216;territorial integrity&#8217; of Ukraine and defending Ukrainian sovereignty from foreign interference are the same nations that in a series of conflicts from the Balkans to Afghanistan to Iraq have helped undermine notions of national sovereignty and territorial integrity in the name of a greater good when it suited them to do so. \n\nIt is not surprising that Russian President Vladimir Putin should use the language of &#8216;protection&#8217;, &#8216;self-determination&#8217; and &#8216;opposition to fascism&#8217; to justify his military intervention in Crimea. Mr. Putin&#8217;s absurd self-justifications should not be taken seriously. But the fact that he can use such justifications reflects the way that Western actions over the past two decades have helped shape the language of &#8216;humanitarian&#8217; intervention.\n\n\nWestern politicians fail to recognise the strong sentiment that exists in large parts of Ukraine in support of close ties with Russia. A poll conducted by Kiev&#8217;s independent Razumov Centre in January last year revealed that only a third of Crimeans viewed Ukraine as their homeland, while half wanted independence. Seventy per cent wanted closer ties to Russia, compared to 20 per cent who favoured the European Union (EU). Nor are such sentiments exclusive to Crimea. The same poll found that more than half the population in eastern Ukraine wanted closer ties with Russia, whereas fewer than one in five preferred the EU.\n\n\nUkraine is a divided nation. If many in western Ukraine express their disenchantment with corrupt, undemocratic governance through greater support for the EU, many in eastern Ukraine and in Crimea do so through a yearning for closer ties with Moscow. Such pro-Russian sentiment is as important a part of Ukraine&#8217;s democratic voice as are the calls for greater integration with Western Europe. Western politicians&#8217; refusal to take seriously the pro-Russian sentiment, and their support for an unelected government in Kiev that many in Ukraine despise and even fear, can only exacerbate tensions and make more likely the disastrous break-up of Ukraine.\n\n\nIs the struggle in Ukraine a struggle between Russia and the West?\n\n\nThe roots of the current conflict lie in the struggle between Russia and the West for influence in Kiev. Many in the West have come to see that struggle for influence as synonymous with the struggle for liberal democracy. Greater Russian control is certainly likely to lead to greater repression. It is far from clear, though, that greater Western influence will in itself necessarily lead to greater liberty and democracy.\n\n\nWestern powers, while often being the loudest voices in proclaiming the virtues of democracy, have often taken an instrumental view of its desirability, preferring to prop up dictators when it suits their needs. Take, for instance, the West&#8217;s attitude towards Bahrain, a state that has, with considerable bloodshed, and not a little help from neighbouring Saudi Arabia, viciously suppressed the local movement for democratic change. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are, however, important Western allies, particularly in the &#8216;war on terror&#8217;. So the Bahraini opposition movement has been largely ignored, while a regime far more dictatorial than that of Victor Yanukovich continues to be showered with Western favours.\n\n\nThe key struggle in Ukraine is not between Russia and the West. It is for democracy and for those values often associated with the West, but not always promoted by the West. That is why, while we need to oppose Russian strongarm tactics, we need also to be sceptical of Western interference.\n\n\nWhat is black and white in Ukraine is the need for a liberal democratic society, free from corruption and external interference. But the reality of the conflict on the ground is shrouded in many shades of grey. \n\n<i>(Kenan Malik is a writer, lecturer and broadcaster)</i>\n', 'legitimate,global,many,new,many,key,Many,corrupt,authoritarian,robust,public,much,much,democratic,first,popular,different,last,liberal,similar,liberal,military,normal,useful,progressive,democratic,new,authoritarian,old,first,official,other,prospective,interim,symbolic,Russian,other,new,far,ministerial,national,French,European,progressive,illegal,international,Russian,clean,disastrous,ethnic,particular,fearful,Russian,rid,unelected,foreign,same,national,territorial,good,surprising,Russian,military,Western,past,strong,large,close,independent,last,third,such,exclusive,same,many,western,corrupt,undemocratic,many,important,democratic,Western,unelected,many,fear,likely,disastrous,current,synonymous,liberal,likely,clear,instrumental,considerable,bloodshed,local,democratic,important,dictatorial,Russian,sceptical,Western,black,democratic,free,external,many,', ' clean democratic exclusive free good important independent instrumental large legitimate liberal normal popular progressive robust strong useful', ' authoritarian black bloodshed close corrupt dictatorial disastrous fear fearful illegal', 17, -10, 7, 27),

A majority of people in Crimea identify with Russia, and Moscow has a major Naval base on the Black Sea.\n\n\nWhile the U.S. and the E.U. urged Russia to engage in dialogue with new Ukrainian authorities who came to power on the wave of protests that sent President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing to Russia, the Kremlin has refused to do so, denouncing the change of power in Ukraine as &#8220;unconstitutional coup&#8221;.\n\n\nRussia&#8217;s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Saturday that Moscow sees no sense in having a dialogue with Ukraine&#8217;s new authorities because, in his view, they kowtow to radical nationalists.\n\n\n&#8220;The so-called interim government isn&#8217;t independent, it depends, to our great regret, on radical nationalists who have seized power with arms,&#8221; he said at a news conference. He said that nationalist groups use &#8220;intimidation and terror&#8221; to control Ukraine.\n\n\nMeanwhile in Crimea, pro-Russia soldiers late Friday tried to take over a Ukrainian base in a tense standoff that lasted for several hours.\n\n\nLt. Col. Vitaly Onishchenko, deputy commander of the base, said three dozen men wearing unmarked camouflage uniforms arrived late Friday. While one group climbed over a wall on one side of the base, another crashed a heavy military truck through the gates, Mr. Onishchenko said.\n\n\nNo shots were fired in and no injuries were reported, but the incident reflected tensions running high on the Black Sea peninsula. In the week since Russia seized control of Crimea, Russian troops have been neutralizing and disarming Ukrainian military bases there. Some Ukrainian units, however, have refused to give up. Crimea&#8217;s new leader has said pro-Russian forces numbering more than 11,000 now control all access to the region and have blockaded all military bases that haven&#8217;t yet surrendered.\n\n\nRussia has denied that its forces are active in Crimea, describing the troops who wear green uniforms without insignia as local &#8220;self-defence forces&#8221;.

They spoke with Russian accents and they didn&#8217;t hide their allegiance to the Russian Federation. But they didn&#8217;t have any distinguishing marks (on their uniforms). Without doubt, this was a Russian action.&#8221;\n\n\nRussia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow has no intention of annexing Crimea, but says its people have the right to determine the region&#8217;s status in a referendum.\n\n\nThe Crimean referendum has been denounced by Ukraine&#8217;s new government, and U.S. President Barack Obama says it would violate international law.

Voters in the Crimean Peninsula will be given two options: becoming part of Russia or remaining in Ukraine with broader powers. The U.S. and Europe have declared the referendum illegitimate, saying Ukraine&#8217;s central government must be involved in decisions about its territory. \n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said Mr. Yatsenyuk&#8217;s visit was meant to signal &#8220;that we strongly support Ukraine, the Ukrainian people and the legitimacy of the new Ukrainian government.&#8221; \n\nAmid the symbolism of Mr. Yatsenyuk&#8217;s visit to the U.S., the Ukrainian leader will also be seeking financial assistance from Washington. Mr. Yatsenyuk says his country needs the West&#8217;s help to defend itself against neighboring Russia, a nation he said is &#8220;armed to the teeth.&#8221; \n\nUkraine&#8217;s parliament installed Mr. Yatsenyuk as head of the country&#8217;s interim government after pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych fled the capital of Kiev following three months of popular protests. The uprising started when Mr. Yanukovych rejected a planned partnership agreement with the European Union in favour of historical ties with Moscow. \n\nDays after Mr. Yanukovych left Kiev, Russia moved military forces into Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far brushed aside punishments levied by the West following the incursion, including visa bans, the threat of economic sanctions and a halt to planning for an international economic summit Russia is scheduled to host in June. \n\nRussia does not recognize the new government nor the elections planned in Ukraine in May. \n\nA possible path for de-escalating the dispute emerged on Tuesday, when Crimea&#8217;s parliament said that if the public votes to become part of Russia, the peninsula will declare itself independent and propose becoming a Russian state. That could give Moscow the option of saying there is no need for Crimea to become part of Russia, while keeping it firmly within its sphere of influence. \n\nMr. Yatsenyuk will be greeted at the White House Wednesday by all of the grandeur of a head of state visit, including an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Obama. The two leaders were expected to make brief comments to the media following their discussions. \n\nVice President Joe Biden, who has served as a primary administration contact with Ukraine&#8217;s old and new government, has cut short a trip to Latin America to attend the meeting. Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with Mr. Yatsenyuk in Kiev last week, is also expected to have a separate meeting with the prime minister. \n\nMr. Obama and other administration officials are expected to reinforce their commitment to boost Ukraine&#8217;s fragile new government. The U.S. has promised Ukraine $1 billion in loan guarantees, as well as technical support as it moves toward elections. \n\nMr. Obama has urged Congress to quickly approve the loan guarantee, which is supposed to supplement additional assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to vote on Wednesday on a bill that both provides aid to Ukraine and hits Russia with sanctions. \n\nA major sticking point had been a provision in the bill to enhance the lending capacity of the IMF. The Obama administration has pushed hard for acceptance of the IMF changes as part of the legislation authorizing the assistance. Sen. Bob Menendez, the committee chairman, said on Tuesday that IMF revisions would be included in the bill. \n\nThe IMF&#8217;s 2010 revisions expand the power of emerging countries within the global lending body and make some of its funds more readily available. The United States is the only country on the IMF board that hasn&#8217;t accepted the changes yet. \n\nSen. Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday he supported the IMF changes and viewed them as a &#8220;national security&#8221; concern. But several House Republicans have voiced opposition. \n\nThe House last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of the loans to Ukraine. The legislation didn&#8217;t include Russia sanctions or any language on the IMF. \n\nThe European Union has pledged $15 billion in assistance to Ukraine, though even that falls well short of the $35 billion in international rescue loans Kiev says it needs over the next two years.

I am not making a comparison, certainly. But I am recommending that we perhaps can learn from this tactic that has been used before,&#8221; she said. \n\nMs. Clinton said Mr. Putin is trying to &#8220;re-Sovietize&#8221; the periphery of Russia but is actually squandering the potential of his nation and &#8220;threatening instability and even the peace of Europe.&#8221; ', 'Russian,tough,potential,former,potential,presidential,ethnic,similar,familiar,German,other,further,eastern,reminiscent,German,historic,tactic,potential,', ' historic potential reminiscent', '', 3, 0, 3, 3),

Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Kerry urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stand down and said the U.S. is looking for ways to de-escalate the mounting tensions. \n&#8220;It is clear that Russia has been working hard to create a pretext for being able to invade further,&#8221; Mr. Kerry said. &#8220;It is not appropriate to invade a country, and at the end of a barrel of a gun dictate what you are trying to achieve. That is not 21-century, G-8, major nation behaviour.&#8221; \nMr. Kerry made a pointed distinction between the Ukrainian government and Mr. Putin&#8217;s. \n&#8220;The contrast really could not be clearer- determined Ukrainians demonstrating strength through unity, and the Russian government out of excuses, hiding its hand behind falsehoods, intimidation and provocations. In the hearts of Ukrainians and the eyes of the world, there is nothing strong about what Russia is doing.&#8221; \nUS President Barack Obama, visiting a Washington, D.C., school to highlight his new budget, said his administration&#8217;s push to punish Mr. Putin put the U.S. on &#8220;the side of history that, I think, more and more people around the world deeply believe in, the principle that a sovereign people, an independent people, are able to make their own decisions about their own lives. And, you know, Mr. Putin can throw a lot of words out there, but the facts on the ground indicate that right now he is not abiding by that principle.&#8221; \nSpeaking at a fundraiser later Tuesday, Mr. Obama said it might be possible for the situation to &#8220;de-escalate in the next several days and weeks.&#8221; \nMr. Obama also spoke for more than an hour on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been in contact with Putin in recent days and whose country has deep economic ties with Russia. \nThe Obama administration announced a $1 billion energy subsidy package in Washington as Mr. Kerry was arriving in Kiev. The fast-moving developments came as the United States readied economic sanctions amid worries that Moscow was ready to stretch its military reach further into the mainland of the former Soviet republic. \nMr. Kerry headed straight to Institutska Street at the start of an hours-long visit intended to bolster the new government that took over just a week ago when Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych fled. Mr. Kerry placed a bouquet of red roses, and twice the Roman Catholic secretary of state made the sign of the cross at a shrine set up to memorialize protesters who were killed during mid-February riots. \n&#8220;We&#8217;re concerned very much. We hope for your help, we hope for your assistance,&#8221; a woman shouted as Mr. Kerry walked down a misty street lined with tires, plywood, barbed wire and other remnants of the barricades that protesters had stood up to try to keep Mr. Yanukovych&#8217;s forces from reaching nearby Maidan Square, the heart of the demonstrations. \nPiles of flowers brought in honour of the dead provided splashes of colour in an otherwise drab day that was still tinged with the smell of smoke. \n&#8220;We will be helping,&#8221; Mr. Kerry said. &#8220;We are helping. President Obama is planning more assistance.&#8221; \nThe Ukraine government continued to grapple with a Russian military takeover of Crimea, a strategic, mostly pro-Russian region in the country&#8217;s southeast, and Mr. Kerry&#8217;s visit came as Mr. Putin said he wouldn&#8217;t be deterred by economic sanctions imposed punitively by the West. \nUkraine Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia told reporters that Ukraine was in a much stronger position today than it was even a week ago, having rallied the support of the U.S. and the West. He said it&#8217;s unlikely Kiev will ever go to war to prevent Russia from annexing Crimea but said doing so wouldn&#8217;t be necessary, describing the economic penalties and diplomatic isolation more painful to Russians than bullets would be. \nU.S. officials travelling with Mr. Kerry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Obama administration is considering slapping Russia with economic sanctions as soon as this week. Members of Congress say they&#8217;re preparing legislation that would impose sanctions as well. \nOfficials said the sanctions could be implemented in tiers, with an initial round of penalties targeted at individuals the U.S. says were involved in the ousted Ukrainian government&#8217;s corrupt activities. Mr. Putin is almost certain to be excluded from those penalties, the officials said, adding that it is rare for the U.S. to directly target a head of state with them. \nAs Mr. Kerry arrived, the White House announced the package of energy aid, along with training for financial and election institutions and anti-corruption efforts. Additionally, the officials said, the U.S. has suspended what was described as a narrow set of discussions with Russia over a bilateral trade investment treaty. It is also going to provide technical advice to the Ukraine government about its trade rights with Russia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be quoted by name before the official announcement was made. \nMr. Putin pulled his forces back from the Ukrainian border on Tuesday, yet said that Moscow reserves the right to use all means to protect Russians in the country but hopes it doesn&#8217;t have to. Mr. Putin declared that Western actions were driving Ukraine into anarchy and warned that any sanctions the West might place on Russia for its actions there will backfire. \nSpeaking from his residence outside Moscow, Mr. Putin said he still considers Mr. Yanukovych to be Ukraine&#8217;s leader and hopes Russia won&#8217;t need to use force in predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. \nIn Washington, the White House said the $1 billion loan guarantee was aimed at helping insulate Ukraine from reductions in energy subsidies. Russia provides a substantial portion of Ukraine&#8217;s natural gas and U.S. officials said they are prepared to work with Kiev to reduce its dependence on those imports. The assistance is also meant to supplement a broader aid package from the International Monetary Fund.

Mr. Obama bluntly warned of unspecified &#8220;costs&#8221; for Russia. \n&#8220;Any violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilising,&#8221; Mr. Obama said on Friday. Such action by Russia would represent a &#8220;profound interference&#8221; in matters that must be decided by the Ukrainian people, he said. \nWhile the president spoke only of &#8220;reports&#8221; of military movements inside Ukraine, the officials said the U.S believes that Russia is intervening. \nSeparately, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he would not address specific U.S. options, &#8220;but this could be a very dangerous situation if this continues in a provocative way.&#8221; Asked about options in a CBS News interview, he said that &#8220;we&#8217;re trying to deal with a diplomatic focus, that&#8217;s the appropriate, responsible approach.&#8221; \nAs Mr. Obama prepared to speak, a spokesman for the Ukrainian border service said eight Russian transport planes had landed with unknown cargo in the largely Russian-friendly Crimea region. Serhiy Astakhov told <i>The Associated Press</i> that the Il-76 planes arrived unexpectedly and were given permission to land, one after the other, at Gvardeiskoye air base. \nThe State Department urged U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel plans to Ukraine because of &#8220;the potential for instability.&#8221; \nIn Washington, it was unclear whether the administration&#8217;s threats might have any impact. Mr. Obama canceled a bilateral meeting with President Vladimir Putin last year after Russia granted asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, though Mr. Obama still attended a separate international meeting in Russia. \nMr. Putin is scheduled to host the Group of Eight economic summit in June in Sochi, the site of the recently completed Winter Olympics. The U.S. is in discussions about the summit with European partners, and it is difficult to see how some of those leaders would attend the summit if Russia has forces in the Crimea, according to the administration officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. \nThe administration&#8217;s warning that trade talks could be halted came as Russian officials were in Washington for economic discussions with Obama advisers. \nFor the U.S., levying punishments on Russia is complicated by the many issues on which the White House needs Moscow&#8217;s help. Among them are ending the bloodshed in Syria, negotiating a nuclear agreement with Iran and transporting U.S. military troops and equipment out of Afghanistan through Russian supply routes. \nPolitical turmoil in Ukraine has pushed President Viktor Yanukovych from office. Mr. Yanukovych held a news conference in Russia on Friday in which he said he was not asking Moscow for military assistance and called military action &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221; \nMr. Yanukovych, who still regards himself the president, also vowed to &#8220;keep fighting for the future of Ukraine&#8221; and blamed the U.S. and the West for encouraging the rebellion that forced him to flee last weekend. \nAny Russian military incursion in the Crimea would dramatically raise the stakes in Ukraine, which is at the center of what many see as a tug of war between East and West. \nOne of the catalysts for massive demonstrations that led to MR. Yanukovych&#8217;s ouster was his rejection of a partnership agreement with the European Union in favour of historical ties with Moscow. That EU agreement would have paved the way for Ukraine&#8217;s greater integration with the West, including potential affiliation with NATO, something to which Russia strongly objects. \nSecretary of State John Kerry and other senior U.S. officials have tried without success to dispel widespread sentiment in Russia that the United States and Europe are trying to pry Ukraine out from under Russian influence. \nTheir argument, though, seems to be falling on deaf ears in Moscow, where Russian officials have been accusing the U.S. and its allies of meddling, fomenting anti-Russia sentiment and actively encouraging Kiev&#8217;s Western aspirations at the expense of its historical connections. \nThere was no known contact on Friday between Obama and Putin, who last spoke a week back. \nMr. Kerry did call Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for the second time in two days to press the Kremlin to keep its promise to respect Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mr. Kerry said he warned Moscow against military moves in the Crimea that could further inflame tensions. \nMr. Lavrov repeated Mr. Putin&#8217;s pledge to do just that while also pointing out that Russia has broad interests in Ukraine, Mr. Kerry said. \nMr. Kerry reiterated the U.S. view that Russian military intervention in Ukraine would run counter to Russia&#8217;s self-professed opposition to such operations in other countries, such as Libya and Syria.

It even simmers in a pot of tea.\nAn island fortress of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, a Gulag during the Stalin years, Sviyazhsk is now better known as a venue for an open tournament in archery. It has paid the price of being located at the crossroads of history &#8212; Sviyazhsk has been taken and lost by every power that has ruled the Russian steppes. And yet it has risen from the proverbial ashes every time. The island has even survived the onslaught of mass tourism; despite the hordes of day trippers it continues to remain a ghost town, where one can almost hear the clash of warriors who fought to rule it through the ages.\nIt&#8217;s a day of brilliant sunshine as I drive the 25-odd miles from Kazan to Sviyazhsk. A causeway connects the highway to the island, and high on a bluff, accessed by a stairway, stands the wooden fortress built in 1550. Far below flow the dark roiling waters of the Volga and Sviyaga rivers. Above stands the copper-domed gateway to the Dormition Monastery. Women in headscarves cross themselves on the green lawns. Monks work inside the black-topped churches now gleaming in restored splendour. But the monastery&#8217;s past has been far from peaceful. The building that houses the monks has been renovated seven times since it was built in the 17th Century. Used as a prison of the Gulag, its quiet rooms housed a psychiatric ward until the 1990s. A lonely thrush sings in the corner of the courtyard where stand the graves of political dissidents and a stone monument to the monks who were executed during the Great Purge of 1937-38.\nSviyazhsk&#8217;s violent past had its roots in the face-off between the Kazan Khan and the Moscow-based Tsar over four hundred years ago. Kazan was an impregnable fortress that had shrugged off many attempts by the Tsar to capture the upper reaches of the Volga. On one of his retreats, Ivan the Terrible decided to make Sviyazhsk his base and raised the fortress within a month. And so, for nearly three centuries, it was a prosperous county town, a remote frontier of Christianity in a Muslim province.\nAcross the road from the monastery stand old houses, weathered and listing &#8212; remnants of the time of Lenin and Trotsky. Some of the houses, lovingly restored, have pictures of the forced labour camps under Stalin. Schoolboys sit astride the cannon outside the museum, while others ride horses at the corral. What were once stables have now been converted into an interactive village centre. Visitors try their hand at the smithy, fawn, over-embroidered clothes and gulp down great quantities of borscht. The Russian Orthodox Church took over the island&#8217;s many churches only in 2010. Pilgrims make their way from the wooden Trinity Church built during the course of a day. But it is the compellingly beautiful silver-topped cathedral of the Mother of God that draws me in. A priest in grand robes stands at the gilded entrance. This is the place to pray if one feels the world is too much with him. Classical lines of the Renaissance meld into the poetic curves of the Baroque. On the vaulted ceiling, colour greets the eye and the walls are emblazoned with heraldic coats of arms and Byzantine portraits of saints. A sliver of light falls across the floor and illumines a concentrated collection of lamps.\nFurther down the road, framed against the river, stand the twin churches of St. Konstantin and St. Elena. The aisles are quiet except for the wind that whispers the tales of three agitated centuries. Beside, on a spit of rocky land, wreathed in roses, stands a monument erected to those who were executed on the island. Streets run in grids here past the mournful ruins of houses. I sit on a garden bench and talk to Georgy Andrazhov, who is excited when he realises I&#8217;m from the land of the Kapoors and the Khans. In the distance, beyond the crenelated walls, barges sound their departure. There is a stirring in the little cottages as the locals light the evening fires. As I leave the bells toll the hour and inadvertently recount the history that once rumbled through these lands.\n<i>(The writer was in Russia at the invitation of Ministry of Youth Affairs, Sports and Tourism, Republic of Tatarstan)</i>', 'past,past,open,proverbial,brilliant,high,green,restored,17th,quiet,psychiatric,thrush,political,impregnable,many,upper,prosperous,old,interactive,smithy,great,many,beautiful,cathedral,much,poetic,vaulted,heraldic,light,concentrated,quiet,rocky,past,mournful,little,', ' beautiful brilliant great impregnable light open poetic prosperous', ' little mournful rocky', 8, -3, 5, 11),

Russia is a holdout". The U.S. President bluntly asserted that John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, and others "have delivered a very direct message to the Russians that they cannot say they are concerned about the well-being of the Syrian people when there are starving civilians. ... [I]t is not\njust the Syrians that are responsible; the Russians, as well, if they are blocking this kind of resolution".\nBut the Russians, fully alive to the use of humanitarian intervention by the West for engineering "regime change" in Libya earlier, seemed hardly impressed by the presidential diatribe. In his spirited riposte, Russian deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov pointed out that any resolution at the UN must also take into account the threat posed by al-Qaeda and affiliated organisations in Syria. "It is necessary to deal both with the terrorist threat and the humanitarian disaster in a comprehensive manner," he observed.\nOn Friday, President Obama had warned that fresh pressure would be mounted on the government of Syrian President, Bashar Al Assad. Accompanied by Jordan''s King Abdullah II, he stressed that "there are\ngoing to be some immediate steps that we have to take to help the humanitarian assistance there (in Syria)".\nThe President''s remarks coincided with a report in the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>(WSJ) that Saudi Arabia has offered to supply the Syrian opposition with anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, apparently to offset the air and heavy weapons advantage over the opposition that the government forces currently exercise. The <i>WSJ</i> write-up observed that Russian-made antitank guided missiles and Chinese man-portable air-defence systems have already been stored in warehouses in Jordan and Turkey.\nSyrian opposition commanders had struck a deal on the new armaments shipment during a meeting with agents from the United States and Saudi intelligence in Jordan on January 30, the daily reported.\nAttempts to mount fresh military pressure on the Syrian government have coincided with a sterile on-going dialogue that has been going on in Geneva between the official representatives and the opposition.\nThis has caused Russia to pointedly accuse U.S. and France of attempting to derail talks in the Swiss city. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, blamed Paris and Washington on Friday of making a systematic attempt to provoke the Syrian government to "slam the door" at the Geneva-2 peace conference. He added that Moscow supported the Syrian government''s approach to implement step-by-step, the broad principles anchored by the 2012 Geneva communiquÃ© to achieve durable peace.

The Opposition said the conference should seek to establish a transitional government with full executive powers &#8220;in which killers and criminals do not participate.&#8221; \n\nThat cleared the way for the conference to open Wednesday as planned n the Swiss resort city of Montreux, with high&#8212;ranking delegations from the United States, Russia and close to 40 other countries attending. Face-to-face negotiations between the Syrian Government and its opponents, the first of the uprising, are to start on Friday in Geneva. \n\nBut Russia and Iran, Syrian President Bashar Assad&#8217;s two closest allies, criticized the U.N. over the decision to exclude Tehran. \n\nIn Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ban&#8217;s decision to rescind Iran&#8217;s invitation was a mistake, but that Moscow would try to make the negotiations work. \n\n&#8220;There is no catastrophe, we will push for a dialogue between the Syrian parties without any preconditions,&#8221; Lavrov said at a news conference. \n\nAt the same time, Lavrov took a jab at Ban, saying his decision on Iran &#8220;hasn&#8217;t helped strengthen the U.N. authority,&#8221; and that recalling the offer looked &#8220;unseemly.&#8221; \n\nThe controversy over Iran&#8217;s participation in the talks reflected deep differences over Syria between the United States and Russia, which has been a key ally of Damascus, shielding Syrian President Bashar Assad&#8217;s regime from U.N. sanctions and continuing to supply it with weapons throughout the civil war that has killed more than 130,000. \n\nLavrov reaffirmed Russia&#8217;s stance that the presence of Iran was essential for the success of the talks. \n\nIran has been Assad&#8217;s main regional ally, supporting his regime with advisers, money and materiel since the uprising began in 2011. \n\nIn Tehran, Iran&#8217;s Foreign Ministry sharply criticized Ban&#8217;s diplomatic about&#8212;face. \n\n&#8220;From our point of view, the withdrawal is deplorable,&#8221; ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said, adding that the U.N. chief only did so under immense pressure. \n\nAfkham said that Iran expects Ban Ki&#8212;moon will explain the &#8220;real reasons&#8221; for withdrawing the invitation.

He called on followers &#8220;to use maximum force on the path of Allah to disrupt this Satanic dancing.&#8221;\nThe murderous terrorist bombing in the southern Russian city of Volgograd on Sunday, carried out by a woman suicide bomber fired by Mr. Umarov&#8217;s words, holds out an important lesson to Indians.\nAfter years of terrorist attacks, there is growing public support in India for hard-line action against terrorists. However, the Russian case shows states that unleash maximum force against terrorists don&#8217;t necessarily succeed in stamping out their problems. Nor do efforts to buy out discontent through development or expedient political deals.\nThe Sochi Winter Olympics were meant to be a showpiece for Russia&#8217;s pacification of the Chechen jihadist movement. They are, paradoxically, serving to show how hard it can be to stamp out terrorism.\nLong before Mr. Umarov&#8217;s public threats, Russian intelligence and police services had been warning of attacks in the build-up to February&#8217;s Winter Olympics, to be held in the idyllic resort of Sochi.\nIn October, Naida Asiyalova, 30, killed six persons and wounded 32 others in a suicide-bombing on a bus in Volgograd &#8212; almost identical to Sunday&#8217;s attack. Naida is reported to have been the wife of jihadist Dmitri Sokolov, wanted by Russian authorities for two other terrorist bombings.\nFor more than a decade now, the lethal reach of Chechen separatist commander Shamil Basayev&#8217;s Riyad ul-Saliheen Martyrs Brigade has been repeatedly demonstrated. In 2004, it seized control of a school in the town of Beslan, sparking a siege that claimed 334 lives, 186 of them children. In 2002, the Brigade took 800 people hostage at the Nord-Ost theatre in Moscow, leading to the death of 129 of them. In 2009, 29 were killed when the group bombed a Moscow-bound high-speed train. In 2010, a similar attack claimed the lives of 39 commuters.\nLike other far-away wars, the Chechen insurgency has mostly been ignored by Indians. The Chechen battle against a great power has, however, inspired jihadists across the world.\nMuhammad Abdul Aziz, a one-time Hyderabad electrician educated at the Anwar-ul-Uloom College in Mallepally, known to his friends as Gidda, fought in Grozny in 1996, under the command of Saudi Arabia jihadist Samir Saleh Abdullah al-Suwailem. He also took part in combat against Serbian forces at Zentica in 1994, hoping to learn skills he could use at home.\nMr. Aziz later told Hyderabad police investigators that he had been radicalised by the demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992 &#8212; and hoped for revenge.\n<b>Deep roots</b>\nLike India&#8217;s own insurgencies, the roots of the Islamist insurgency in the north Caucuses go back centuries. In the 1700s, as imperial Russia expanded into territories until then controlled by Iran and Turkey, it faced resistance from local Muslim rulers. Then, in 1940, central Asian Islamists allied with the Nazi Germany in an effort to gain independence from the Soviet Union. The historian, Ian Johnson, has documented the United States&#8217; subsequent sponsorship of these jihadists, seeking to use them against the Soviet Union.\nEven as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991, a war for independence broke out between Russia and the newly formed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Basayev was appointed vice-prime minister of the Chechen Republic by President Aslam Maskhadov in an attempted peace deal.\nIn 1999, though, he attempted to stage a coup in neighbouring Dagestan, and fighting broke out again. President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s troops laid siege to Grozny in 1999-2000, reducing it, the United Nations reportedly said, to &#8220;the most destroyed city on earth.&#8221; Journalist Anna Politkovskaya described it as &#8220;a small corner of hell.&#8221; Basayev himself was killed in 2006.\nFrom the mid-2008 though, the jihadist movement in Chechnya began to gather momentum again. In November that year, Mr. Umarov declared himself the Emir of the so-called Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus. For the past decade, Mr. Umarov has faced a determined adversary in the former warlord Ramzan Kadyrov. Helped by generous assistance from Moscow, Mr. Kadyrov has turned Grozny into an economic hub. But he has been alleged to be complicit in violence directed at human rights activists and political opponents &#8212; and criticised for shari&#8217;a laws that discriminate against women, introduced in a bid to outflank his Islamist opponents.\nThe Sochi Olympics will show the world how far Russia has succeeded in turning a war-zone into a peaceful economic success. They will also demonstrate, though, that the end of war doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the coming of peace.

Itar-Tass has reported that the agreement reached between Iran and the six global powers &#8212; U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany &#8212; would be one of the focal points of talks during the visit. Later on Wednesday, Mr. Lavrov advocated Iran&#8217;s participation in resolving the Syrian crisis.\n\n\nThe Geneva deal was premised on allowing Iran to enrich uranium only below five per cent purity in return for limited sanctions relief for a period of six months. Within this time, both sides are to work out the contours of a permanent agreement to ensure the peaceful orientation of the programme in tune with Tehran&#8217;s sanctions-free accommodation in the international economic mainstream. \n\nMr. Lavrov had earlier said intensive talks during the six months ahead would focus on the parameters of fuel production by Iran to run nuclear power stations, research reactors and others producing isotopes for medical and humanitarian purposes. Mr. Lavrov&#8217;s arrival coincides with expert-level talks that began on Monday in Vienna between Iran and the sextet to discuss the Geneva deal. AFP has reported that it is unlikely that the negotiators would agree on a specific date when Iran has to commence a six month freeze of parts of its nuclear energy programme.\n\n\nAs Mr. Lavrov engaged with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, both sides were aware that the survival of the landmark deal is far from certain. In Washington, John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, battled Congress to dissuade it from passing another set of stringent sanctions, which were likely to push Iran to walk out of negotiations.

He made the weighty remark after holding talks on Thursday with his visiting Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.\nMr. Fahmy&#8217;s comments suggest that the time had arrived to revive the once thriving politico-military relationship between Moscow and Cairo, which had been disrupted by Anwar Sadat, Egypt&#8217;s former President, who chose to become a U.S. ally in the heat of the Cold War.\nWhile evoking nostalgic memories of a bygone era of special ties, Mr. Fahmy cautioned that the Egyptian foreign policy would not be a zero sum game, despite the re-discovery of an old ally. &#8220;Cairo wants to intensify relations. But they won&#8217;t be alternative to anyone,&#8221; he stressed. Mr. Fahmy seemed to address the speculation that the relationship with Washington &#8212; a top Egyptian ally for three decades &#8212; was on a downward spiral, after the military toppled the elected President Mohamed Morsy in July.\nTies between Egypt and the United States in recent months seemed to have lost some of its old lustre &#8212; a perception that deepened with Washington&#8217;s decision to withhold military supplies to Cairo, following Mr. Morsy&#8217;s ouster, and the heavy crackdown on his supporters that followed. The Egyptian Army called Washington&#8217;s decision &#8220;strange,&#8221; and did little to mask its angst. It stressed that U.S. support at this time is particularly vital as &#8220;Egypt is facing a war against terrorism&#8221;&#8212; a pointed reference to a growing insurgency in the badlands of the Sinai desert that the army has been battling at considerable cost.\nIn Cairo, Mr. Lavrov was accompanied by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu &#8212; a signal that the military ties were once again likely to break the decades of estrangement of the two countries.

Russia&#8217;s permanent presence at the port of Tartus in Syria has already underscored its intentions to implant a strategic footprint in these waters. In September, a Russian flotilla had docked close to the Syrian coastline, when tensions churned by imminent strikes against Syria by the United States, had risen dramatically.\nOn Thursday, Egyptian Defence Minister, General Abdel Fattah El-Sisi joined Mr. Fahmy for talks with the visiting delegation. He pointed out that Egypt and Russia &#8220;will continue strategic relationship, which is opening a new stage in constructive and fruitful military cooperation&#8221;.\nHowever, the Russian delegation did make oblique references to the need for the restoration of democracy, which was disrupted by the military takeover of the country in July. &#8220;Strong and democratic Egypt will be an important factor to maintain peace in the Middle East.

Key points of the deal: \n\nThis would keep Iran&#8217;s enrichment level well below the threshold needed for weapons-grade material, which is more than 90 percent enrichment. Uranium enriched to 5 per cent is adequate to make fuel for Iran&#8217;s lone energy-producing reactor in Bushehr on the Persian Gulf coast. For Iran, the ability to keep its enrichment program is a critical issue. Iran&#8217;s leaders insist they maintain self-sufficiency over the entire nuclear cycle from mining uranium to making nuclear fuel. \n\n<b>&#8216;NEUTRALISE&#8217; IRAN&#8217;S STOCKPILE OF 20 PER CENT ENRICHED URANIUM </b>\n\n\nThis level of enrichment is within several steps of reaching weapons grade. Eliminating the stockpile eases Western concerns that Iran possibly could move quickly toward a nuclear weapon. Iran can either convert the 20 percent uranium into reactor-ready fuel, which effectively blocks it from further enrichment. Or Iran can dilute the material to levels below 5 percent enrichment. Iranian officials have said the country has a sufficient stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium for long-term operations of its research reactor, which runs at the higher-level uranium and produces isotopes for medical treatments and other uses. Allowing Iran to use the stockpile for domestic purposes is an important political takeaway for Tehran. Iranian leaders had balked at demands to ship the stockpile out of the country. \n\n<b>NO NEW CENTRIFUGES </b>\n\n\nThis effectively freezes Iran&#8217;s enrichment capacities for the next six months. Centrifuges are used to turn concentrated uranium into nuclear fuel. Iran, however, is allowed to keep its two main enrichment facilities in operation. Iran&#8217;s government, which negotiated the deal with world powers in Geneva, would have faced huge backlash from hard-liners at home if either of the labs were forced to shut down. \n\n<b>SUSPEND WORK AT THE ARAK REACTOR </b>\n\n\nThe planned Arak reactor in central Iran is a &#8220;heavy water&#8221; plant, which means it uses a molecular variant of water as a coolant and can run on non-enriched uranium. It also produces a higher degree of plutonium byproduct, which could be extracted and potentially used in weapons production. Iran&#8217;s agreement not to build a plutonium reprocessing facility deals directly with the weapons program concerns. It also could clear the way for future agreements to resume work on the reactor. \n\n<b>IRAN&#8217;S PLEDGE TO ADDRESS U.N. CONCERNS, INCLUDING THE PARCHIN MILITARY SITE </b>\n\n\nThe specific mention of the Parchin military base near Tehran touches on a longstanding impasse between Iran and the U.N.&#8217;s nuclear watchdog organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency. U.N. inspectors want to revisit the site to investigate suspicions of past explosive tests that could have applications in nuclear bomb designs. Iran denies the claim. Iran has said further inspections are possible, but also wanted to impose restrictions that limits on public disclosures by the U.N. agency.

Describing the carrier as adding a whole new dimension to the operational capabilities of the Navy, he said the event realised the vision of the Navy&#8217;s capability-based transformation, conceived over a decade ago.\n\n\n&#8220;India&#8217;s economic development is dependent on the seas, and safeguarding the nation&#8217;s maritime interests is central to our national policy. Aircraft carriers have been part of the Indian Navy&#8217;s force structure since our independence and have effectively served the country over the past five decades or so,&#8221; he said. Mr. Rogozin saw the carrier as symbolising close ties between both nations. \n\nAdmiral Joshi viewed the induction as catalysing the India-Russia strategic partnership to greater heights. On the need for a three-carrier Navy, he said that given India&#8217;s vast seascape, far-flung islands, regional geopolitics and the dynamic maritime security environment, aircraft carriers were necessary to implement India&#8217;s strategic interest in the region. The transformation of a Heavy Aircraft Carrier Cruiser into a modern short-take off but arrested recovery (STOBAR) air defence platform was challenging for both nations, he said.\n\n\nOn Saturday morning, the dignitaries were given a ceremonial Guard of Honour by Indian and Russian naval personnel. The Russian flag on the modernised vessel was lowered. Soon after Captain (Commodore) Suraj Berry, Vikramaditya&#8217;s commanding officer, read out the commissioning order, the Indian tricolour was hoisted on the vessel with a 34-men colour guard led by Lieutenant Commander H. Mehta in attendance.

By the end of 2007, when it became clear that Russia will not deliver the radically redesigned vessel by 2008 deadline, the relations dipped to an all-time low.\n\n\nHowever, the two countries inked an additional agreement under which India agreed to pay a higher price for its refit.\n\n\nIn their private discussions Indian officials conceded that even with the cost escalation, it was a good deal, since a similar vessel would cost not less than double the price in the international market, but nobody makes aircraft carriers for export.\n\n\n&#8220;Almost everything on the Vikramaditya is new,&#8221; Chief Delivery Commissioner of Sevmash shipyard, Igor Leonov said.\n\n\nTalking to <i>PTI</i> on the jetty of the Sevmash, where the 4,500-tonne aircraft carrier was being prepared for the commissioning ceremony, Mr. Leonov said only 40 per cent hull of the vessel was original while rest was absolutely new.\n\n\n&#8220;The Indian Navy, which always maintained its engineers and technicians on the vessel throughout the refit and modernisation process took the right decision to change many aggregates, components and entire cabling, instead of their repairs,&#8221; he said. \n\nMr. Leonov will lead the onboard Russian guaranty team during the Vikramaditya&#8217;s almost two-month voyage to its home base on the Western coast of India in Karwar.

Travelling at a speed of 12 miles per second, the rock exploded with the energy of around 500 kilotonnes of TNT, researchers found.\n\n\nDirectly beneath the meteor&#8217;s path, the shock wave was powerful enough to knock people off their feet. Windows were shattered in more than 3,600 apartment blocks, and a factory roof collapsed.\n\n\nIn the local library in Yemanzhelinsk, 30 miles away, a statue of Pushkin cracked when it was struck by a blown-out window frame. At least 1,210 people were treated for injuries, most from falling building debris and flying glass.\n\n\nAt its most intense, the streaking fireball glowed 30 times brighter than the sun, leaving people on the ground below with skin and retinal burns. One resident in Korkino, 18 miles from the point of peak brightness, lost skin from their face after being burned by radiation. The intense heat evaporated three quarters of the meteor. Around four to six tonnes reached the ground as meteorites, representing just 0.05 per cent of the original rock.\n\n\nThe Chelyabinsk airburst was the largest since Tunguska in 1908, but unlike that and other historic events, the strike was recorded by a full suite of modern technology: satellites photographed the meteor from space; security and personal video cameras filmed the rock&#8217;s violent path across the sky; and sensors picked up infrasound waves as lumps hit the ground.\n\n\nThe largest single piece, weighing around 650kg, punched a seven metre-wide hole in ice 70cm thick on Lake Chebarkul, and was recovered from the lake bed in October.\n\n\nAn international team of researchers, led by Olga Popova at the Russian Academy of Sciences, visited Chelyabinsk and 50 nearby villages in the weeks after the event to map the extent of the destruction. The shockwave left a trail of damage 55 miles on either side of the rock&#8217;s trajectory, according to a report in the journal, Science.\n\n\n&#8220;Our goal was to understand all circumstances that resulted in the damaging shockwave that sent over 1,200 people to hospitals in the Chelyabinsk Oblast area that day,&#8221; said Peter Jenniskens at Nasa&#8217;s Ames Research Centre in California.\n\n\nThe unforeseen arrival of the meteor and the violence of its impact were a wake-up call, according to Qing-Zhu Yin, an author on the study at the University of California, Davis. &#8220;If humanity does not want to go the way of the dinosaurs, we need to study an event like this in detail,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nFurther details of the Chelyabinsk strike appear in two reports in the journal Nature. The first, led by Jir Borovicka at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, traces the orbit of the meteor back to another object, known as asteroid 86039. This asteroid has also orbited close to Earth and was probably once part of the same rock as the Chelyabinsk meteor.\n\n\nThe second Nature study, led by Peter Brown at the University of Western Ontario, calculated the energy of the Chelyabinsk airbust at 400 to 600 kilotonnes of TNT, but found that scientists&#8217; models for estimating damage from airbursts were off the mark. The glitch in the models means that the number of space rocks with sizes of the order of tens of metres, which pose a threat, may be ten times greater than previously thought.\n\n\n<b>&#8212; Â© Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2013</b>\n', 'complete,second,powerful,local,intense,retinal,original,other,historic,full,modern,personal,single,international,nearby,first,Czech,asteroid,asteroid,close,same,second,Guardian,', ' guardian historic modern original powerful', ' close', 5, -1, 4, 6),

(323, '1979', 'October 31, 2013', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-tale-of-two-handshakes/article5297752.ece', '\nWittingly or unwittingly, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh gave two different meanings to handshakes when he visited Moscow and Beijing last week. At the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Dr. Singh said on October 21: &#8220;Every handshake reveals the warmth of the ties between our two people. Together, they create an unmatched platform for the future.&#8221; Two days later, in Beijing, the Prime Minister said after talks with Premier Li Keqiang: &#8220;We account for 2.5 billion people. When India and China shake hands, the world takes notice.&#8221;\n\n\nThe first handshake referred to the comfort of a strategic relationship that had defined India&#8217;s diplomacy over the years; the second placed India and China in the domain of &#8220;re-emerged&#8221; nations, whose import the world is still contending with.\n\n\nAt a time when considerable time and energy are being expended in pushing China and India to take the stage as rivals, the repeated contacts between the two countries take some of the sting out of this narrative. With the United States keen on curbing Chinese influence, India is seen as the obvious counter-weight to China, a prospect Delhi has rejected time and again in public. In nuanced references, Dr. Singh made it plain last week that the India-Russia handshake was time-tested; the one with China was new and continued to attract global attention given the economic strength of the two Asian nations.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister&#8217;s two terms at the helm will be known for a strategic embrace of the U.S. and its policies, but his praise for Russia and what it had done for India was generous and full-throated. &#8220;India has benefited enormously from Russian support in every aspect of India&#8217;s national development efforts &#8212; be it the development of heavy industry, the power sector, our space programme or... our defence needs... Russia has stood by India at moments of great international challenge, when our own resources were limited and our friends were few... it is this last fact that Indians will never forget,&#8221; Dr. Singh said.\n\n\n<b>Special and privileged</b>\n\n\nReferring to the relationship with Russia as special and privileged, the Prime Minister was generous in his praise for Moscow. &#8220;Russia offered us partnership in nuclear energy when the world still shunned nuclear commerce with us. I take particular joy in informing this august audience that the first unit of the Kudankulam nuclear power plant, built with Russian assistance, went critical in July this year and that the second one should be commissioned early next year. The Indian oil company ONGC&#8217;s largest overseas presence is in Russia,&#8221; he stressed.\n\n\nBeyond the comfort zone of Russia, the Prime Minister, who flew to Beijing from Moscow, reflected a new confidence when it came to raising difficult issues in public with China. Given that this was his third meeting in 2013 with the top Chinese leadership, his comments should silence some of his harsh, hawkish critics at home.\n\n\nAfter listing a host of common concerns and the need for a joint approach, Dr. Singh possibly became the first Indian leader to put his concerns to the Chinese publicly on Chinese soil. Usually, these concerns are placed off-the-record to accompanying Indian mediapersons.\n\n\n&#8220;Naturally, there are also concerns on both sides &#8212; whether it is incidents in the border region, trans-border rivers or trade imbalances. Our recent experiences have shown that these issues can become impediments to the full exploitation of the opportunities for bilateral and multilateral cooperation between India and China...,&#8221; he said at the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s central party school.\n\n\nSo, recent tensions on the India-China boundary, concerns about Chinese activity on the Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra river system, as well as issues of trade imbalance figured in these full-spectrum remarks.\n\n\n<b>Beyond bilateralism</b>\n\n\nGoing beyond the pure bilateral domain, Dr. Singh spoke about the need to put in place a rule-based security architecture which, he hoped, would promote security and stability in the larger Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\n&#8220;Above all, India and China need a stable, secure and prosperous Asia-Pacific region. The centre of gravity of global opportunities and challenges is shifting to this region. In the coming decades, China and India, together with the United States, Japan, Korea and the ASEAN community, will be among the largest economies in the world.&#8221;\n\n\nIn an obvious reference to China&#8217;s many unresolved maritime disputes with its neighbours, Dr. Singh said: &#8220;While this region embodies unparalleled dynamism and hope, it is also one with unsettled questions and unresolved disputes. It will be in our mutual interest to work for a cooperative, inclusive and rule-based security architecture that enhances our collective security and regional and global stability.&#8221;\n\n\nA job politely but directly done. There was no anger here, just an expression of concern. Given India&#8217;s and China&#8217;s high stakes in peace and stability, raising concerns before a key audience in China is surely something that Indians concerned about China should appreciate.\n\n\nSetting out a larger strategic direction for bilateral relations, Dr. Singh said: &#8220;More than ever before, the world needs both countries to prosper together. We were not destined to be rivals, and we should show determination to become partners. Our future should be defined by cooperation and not by confrontation. It will not be easy, but we must spare no effort.&#8221;\n\n\nAfter visits to the U.S., Russia and China, the Prime Minister&#8217;s high noon of foreign policy is, clearly, coming to a close. The intent of his remarks in Russia and China could well indicate his desire to spell out his legacy, and a direction for the future. While he fanned the warmth and strength of India&#8217;s relationship with Russia, Dr. Singh also conveyed a solid message that our ties with China can continue to grow if impediments are dealt with speedily. A clearer message to China and its leadership could not have been conveyed.\n\n\nAs India hurtles to a fractious and noisy election, Dr. Singh&#8217;s China visit has passed without cries of a &#8220;sell-out&#8221; from the principal opposition, whose interest in global politics and bilateral relations appears to be both selective and limited. At a time when Russian and Indian leaders meet annually in Moscow or New Delhi, and there are repeated bilateral interactions with the Chinese, there is need to move beyond immediate outcomes in the form of agreements in assessing the quality of bilateral relationships.\n\n\n<b>Not a dampener</b>\n\n\nAlthough hopes of a possible deal on Kudankulam getting two additional Russian nuclear reactors were raised before Dr. Singh left for Moscow, in the end these did not materialise. Given the complex and tortuous nature of concerns surrounding any new deal, the lack of agreement hardly comes as a surprise. In a situation where both Russia and India remain engaged in dialogue, the inability to reach an agreement should not come as a dampener.\n\n\nThe media, perhaps, need to shed its obsession with the &#8220;immediate&#8221; in India&#8217;s dealings with key nations and instead look at the long-term trajectory of relations with these countries. Engagement, it seems, is going to be a continuous process. Days after Dr. Singh concluded his visit to Russia and China, there will be a dialogue of Russia-India-China Foreign Ministers on the sidelines of the Asem (Asia-Europe Meeting) Foreign Ministers&#8217; meeting in New Delhi on November 10-11, another sign of consistent engagement.\n\n\nThat is the nature of modern-day diplomacy. It&#8217;s never-ending.\n\n\nTo my mind, the tone and tenor of Dr. Singh&#8217;s comments in Moscow and China should act as a guiding principle for his successor.\n\n\n<i>(Amit Baruah is an independent, Delhi-based journalist, who has worked with </i>The Hindu<i>, </i>Hindustan Times<i> and </i>BBC<i>.

The stress on air defence is natural, as Iran apprehends a potent threat of massive air strikes by Israel and the U.S. against its well-dispersed atomic infrastructure, apparently to undermine its perceived nuclear weapon ambitions.\n\n\nIran&#8217;s Fars News Agency (FNA) is reporting that the two commanders also discussed missile systems, a veiled reference to the game-changing S-300 air-defence missiles that Moscow had contracted for, but reneged from supplying Tehran, citing the passage of the U.N. sanctions against Iran as the impediment. Russia&#8217;s refusal to part with the S-300 missiles, which can down high-speed incoming missiles and aircraft, has since emerged as a major irritant in Moscow-Tehran ties.\n\n\nBut with the geopolitical situation transforming rapidly following attempts at regime change in Syria by prominent Gulf States and western powers, the Iranians are showing fresh willingness to reinforce their military bonds with Moscow. Analysts point out that Iran and Russia are committed to the prevention of regime-change in Damascus, fearing that such an eventuality would expose energy-rich Iran, situated on the crossroads of the Gulf, Central Asia, Europe and Caucasia, to a dangerous level of subversion.\n\n\nExpressing its readiness to forge special military ties with Moscow, Iran&#8217;s leadership took recourse to an unusual headline-grabbing gesture. On Monday, Gen. Esmayeeli handed over the Russian visitor a model of the U.S. ScanEagle drone that the naval component of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had captured last year, and later reverse-engineered.\n\n\n&#8220;The drone built by the IRGC is a symbol of the technical capabilities of the Islamic Iran and today we presented a real model of it as a gift to [Russian Air Force Commander] lieutenant General Viktor Bondarev and the Russian people,&#8221; said Gen. Esmayeeli.\n\n\nHoping to fast-track military ties, Moscow and Tehran are working hard to overcome the S-300 hurdle. According to FNA, the Russians have offered Iran Tor air defence systems as an alternative to the S-300 missiles. But Tehran may be more inclined to consider acquisitions of the Antei-2500 missiles as these weapons are used to protect mobile ground troops from aerial attack &#8212; an aspect that appeals to Iran, which would depend on large deployment of land forces in any future combat.\n\n\nRussia&#8217;s attempt to weave a durable security relationship with Iran follows its inroads into Syria. Diplomatic sources say that Moscow&#8217;s military footprint in Syria has qualitatively expanded following the Russia-brokered deal, which commits Damascus to shed its arsenal of chemical weapons.

While Dr. Singh would have liked to ink the agreement during his Moscow visit, the fact remains concerns regarding supplier&#8217;s liability are nowhere close to being sorted out. India&#8217;s civil nuclear liability law &#8212; which bears the right of recourse against suppliers &#8212; has weighed heavily on the negotiations. The Russians want the original Intergovernmental Agreement regarding Units 1 and 2 &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; into the new one. This would render the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) liable for damage resulting from an accident. Although India initially insisted &#8212; rightly in our opinion &#8212; that the domestic liability regime govern the new agreement, subsequent signals emanating from New Delhi have been confusing. Last year, the Department of Atomic Energy suggested that rules regarding suppliers&#8217; liability will not apply to the agreement for reactors 3 and 4. The DAE&#8217;s remarks invited the attention of the Prime Minister himself, who sought to clarify its position. The PM intervened knowing full well that any concessional treatment to Russia on this count would trigger similar demands from France and the United States. Under the circumstances, Moscow will likely raise the reactor prices.\n\n\nMeanwhile, both governments have held up Unit 1&#8217;s synchronisation with the regional power grid as testimony to their robust strategic relationship. Dr. Singh&#8217;s assurance that negotiations will be completed within the earliest possible timeframe is welcome. But to arrive at a deal that assuages Russia&#8217;s concerns on suppliers&#8217; liability, the government needs to foster greater domestic dialogue on the intrinsically connected issue of safety. The Supreme Court&#8217;s green signal earlier this year to commissioning KKNP came with several caveats. Periodic safety reviews, as the Court mandated, can only be effective if the regulatory body that oversees the process is independent. Given the concerns expressed about the Atomic Energy Regulatory Body&#8217;s functioning, it is unrealistic to expect a groundswell of support for the Prime Minister&#8217;s vision for Kudankulam. The Public Accounts Committee has gone so far as to say the AERB has &#8220;remained [&#8230;] a mere subordinate authority with powers delegated to it by the Central government.&#8221; If the government wishes to seal the deal for Units 3 and 4, it needs to take the public and the government of Tamil Nadu into confidence. As he nears the end of his second, and probably last, term as PM, Dr. Singh&#8217;s foreign policy legacy will be conditioned by domestic support, not by his personal equations with foreign leaders.\n', 'unsuccessful,important,foreign,close,original,new,liable,domestic,new,subsequent,full,concessional,similar,regional,possible,domestic,green,several,effective,regulatory,unrealistic,mere,second,last,foreign,domestic,personal,foreign,', ' effective important original', ' close liable mere unrealistic unsuccessful', 3, -5, -2, 8),

The formula would essentially waive the liability clause for Units 3 and 4 but should not set a precedent for the United States and France to seek similar exceptions.\n\n\nThere were &#8220;hopes&#8221; the contract for setting up two more reactors in the KNPP might be signed during this month&#8217;s annual summit here between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Vladimir Putin. \n\nAddressing the media after the 19th session of the IRICG, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said the two sides had reached &#8220;important arrangements in very many areas of collaboration&#8221; including &#8220;peaceful uses of nuclear energy.&#8221;\n\n\n<b>Pipeline</b>\n\n\nIn another decision, the two countries agreed to set up a joint study group for an oil pipeline from Russia to India across the former Soviet Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a very big idea for the next 10 years,&#8221; sources in the Indian delegation said. The proposed pipeline would not necessarily be part of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan-India project that was also being planned, though it might run parallel to it, the sources said. \n\nIndia and Russia also finalised a &#8220;programme of cooperation&#8221; in oil and gas on the Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia, the Indian sources said. \n\nThe IRIGC meeting has prepared the ground for large-scale investment deals, as Russia showed &#8220;serious interest&#8221; in the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, India&#8217;s mega infrastructure project.\n\n\nA newly formed working group on investment, which met in Moscow on Thursday, drafted a list of a dozen joint projects.

His growing public profile has made it increasingly risky for the Kremlin to put him behind bars.\n\n\nRegardless of his own inability to hold office, Mr. Navalny, a charismatic speaker with a popular blog, could still prove a vital political force in Russia.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, a judge in the court in Kirov, read out the decision. According to current Russian law, even a suspended sentence would eliminate Mr. Navalny from political office for life.\n\n\nMr. Navalny lambasted the trial, saying the original sentence had been handed down &#8220;on instructions from Moscow&#8221; and that the &#8220;political motivation of this case is absolutely clear.&#8221;\n\n\nThe charges against Mr. Navalny date back a few years to when he worked as an unpaid adviser to the provincial governor in Kirov.

Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov signed an agreement in Geneva on September 13 to put Syria&#8217;s chemical weapons under international control for later destruction, and Mr. Assad&#8217;s government accepted.\nTough negotiations, primarily between Russia and the United States, followed on how Syria&#8217;s stockpile would be destroyed.\nU.S. Ambassador Samantha Power tweeted Thursday evening that the draft resolution establishes that Syria&#8217;s chemical weapons &#8220;is threat to international peace &amp; security &amp; creates a new norm against the use of CW.&#8221;\nWhile the Security Council considers the draft resolution, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the Hague-based body that will be in charge of securing and destroying the stockpile, was working on its own document to set out its exact duties.\nThe U.N. resolution will include the text of the OPCW&#8217;s declaration and make it legally binding, so the OPCW must act first. The OPCW said Thursday it was optimistic it could quickly schedule a meeting of its 41-nation executive council to approve its plan.\nMr. Lavrov said the draft resolution follows the language of the U.S.-Russia agreement reached in Geneva.\nThat agreement did not have an automatic Chapter 7 trigger for enforcement meaning, as France&#8217;s U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud confirmed on Thursday, that a second resolution will be needed if Syria violates the resolution&#8217;s provisions.\nThe draft resolution for the first time would make a determination that &#8220;use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security.&#8221;\nIt would ban Syria from possessing chemical weapons and condemn &#8220;in the strongest terms&#8221; the use of chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, and any other use. It also would ban any country from obtaining chemical weapons or the technology or equipment to produce them from Syria.\nThe draft authorizes the U.N. to send an advance team to assist the OPCW&#8217;s activities in Syria. It asks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to submit recommendations to the Security Council within 10 days of the resolution&#8217;s adoption on the U.N. role in eliminating Syria&#8217;s chemical weapons program.\nThe council would review compliance with the OPCW&#8217;s plans within 30 days, and every month after that.\nSome Western countries had wanted the draft to demand that the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks be referred to the International Criminal Court to be prosecuted for war crimes. Diplomats said this was discussed but Russia objected.\nAs a result, the draft says only that the Security Council &#8220;expresses its strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic should be held accountable.&#8221;\nThe draft resolution is much stronger on the call for a political transition in Syria. It endorses the roadmap for a political transition adopted last year in Geneva by key nations and calls for an international conference to be convened &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221; to implement it. It calls on &#8220;all Syrian parties to engage seriously and constructively&#8221; at a new Geneva conference and be committed &#8220;to the achievement of stability and reconciliation.&#8221;\nThe roadmap for a political transition ends with elections, but there has been no agreement on how to implement it, which would require Mr. Assad to relinquish power at some point.', 'major,controversial,current,full,full,international,global,chemical,late,senior,clear,second,military,powerful,several,recent,diplomatic,military,single,chemical,international,international,later,chemical,international,new,own,exact,optimistic,executive,automatic,second,first,chemical,international,chemical,chemical,other,chemical,chemical,chemical,strong,responsible,chemical,much,political,political,last,key,international,Syrian,new,political,', ' diplomatic optimistic powerful responsible strong', ' controversial', 5, -1, 4, 6),

The city government offered ISKCON a patch of land for temple construction on Leningradsky Prospect, but two years later tore up the agreement following strong protests from the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n\nOrthodox hierarchs objected to the large size of the proposed Krishna temple and its location on the site where thousands of Muscovites had been trampled to death during the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II in 1896.\n\n\nISKCON was offered another plot of land on the sparsely populated outskirts of Moscow, but that was again taken away earlier this year just as the Krishna community was about to launch the construction.\n\n\n&#8220;We spent about 70 million roubles ($2.5 million) donated by our followers on preparing the project, but the Moscow government withdrew its permission just as we completed the long-winding project clearance procedure,&#8221; said Sergei Andreyev, who is in charge of the temple construction at Moscow ISKCON.\n\n\nIn their terse written response to questions from <i>The Hindu</i>, the Moscow Mayor&#8217;s Office cited &#8220;mass protests by residents&#8221; as a reason for cancelling the allocation of land for the Krishna temple.\n\n\nThis argument raised eyebrows at ISKCON.\n\n\n&#8220;The nearest apartment houses are about one kilometre away from where our temple was to be built,&#8221; said Mr. Andreyev.\n\n\nYet, protests did take place a year ago when hundreds of Orthodox Christians and Muslims picketed the site of the would-be Krishna temple to protest the foundation stone laying ceremony.\n\n\nThe Moscow government is now promising to find another site for an ISKCON temple, but is yet to come up with a concrete offer. Meanwhile, the threat of eviction is still hanging over the temporary Krishna temple on Leningradsky Prospect.\n\n\n&#8220;Bailiffs have given us a respite, but they may be back any time, so we&#8217;re moving out our stuff,&#8221; Mr. Andreyev said. &#8220;However, we have no place where to move the temple.&#8221;\n\n\nISKCON devotees argue that the Krishna temple in Moscow has not only religious, but also cultural value for Hindus living in the Russian capital.\n\n\n&#8220;Our temple is the only place to fulfil not only the religious, but also the cultural and social needs of Indians, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Mauritians and Nepalese,&#8221; Priya Das said. &#8220;This also helps their children to keep in touch with their culture and religion.&#8221;\n\n\n<b>Translation ban</b>\n\n\nThe ISKCON temple woes come two years after state prosecutors tried to ban a Russian translation of <i>the Bhagavad-Gita As It Is</i>, accusing the Krishnaites&#8217; sacred book of inspiring &#8220;religious hatred&#8221; and being &#8220;extremist in nature.&#8221; After months of hearings, a court in the Siberian city of Tomsk threw out the case, but the trial left a bad aftertaste in the Krishna community.\n\n\n&#8220;It is difficult to say whether there is some persecution or somebody is against Hinduism in Russia, but if you think logically, you come to the conclusion that there may be some ideological reason behind it,&#8221; Priya Das said.\n\n\nAlthough the Hare Krishna movement was legalised in Russia in 1988 it is still looked upon with suspicion and hostility by many Russians.\n\n\n<b>Ruffling feathers</b>\n\n\nMany priests and theologians of the Russian Orthodox Church, such as leading anti-sect activist Alexander Dvorkin, who heads the Expert Council for Religious Studies at the Russian Ministry of Justice, have branded the Hare Krishna movement as a &#8220;totalitarian sect&#8221; that has nothing to do with mainstream Hinduism.\n\n\nCritics accuse Russian Krishnaites of pursing an aggressive campaign to recruit new worshippers among followers of Russia&#8217;s &#8220;traditional&#8221; religions &#8212; the Russian Orthodox Church, Islam, Buddhism and Judaism.\n\n\nThey say the scale of ISKCON activity in Russia is incomparable with the size of the Indian diaspora estimated at about 15,000 people, including several thousand students. ISKCON operates 120 centres across Russia, runs schools for children, publishes dozens of book titles in Russian and distributes free food to the poor and victims of natural disasters.\n\n\nChristian and Muslim activists have repeatedly protested against <i>ratha yatra </i>rituals, held by ISKCON across Russia every year &#8220;under the guise&#8221; of a festival of Indian culture.\n\n\n&#8220;They obtain permission to have a cultural event, but instead engage in shameless propaganda of their religious teachings,&#8221; fumed Father Rafail of the Iveron Monastery in Vorkuta, a city of coalminers in Russia&#8217;s Arctic region. &#8220;They hand out religious books, sing the glory of Krishna and offer people <i>prasada</i>, which is consecrated food.&#8221;\n\n\nThe priest compared Hare Krishna to Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese doomsday cult.\n\n\nReligion expert Mikhail Sitnikov denounced the campaign unleashed by the Russian Orthodox Church against ISKCON as a case of &#8220;Christian fundamentalism.&#8221;\n\n\n&#8220;The Russian Orthodox Church sees the Society for Krishna Consciousness as a strong competitor and is trying to oust it from Russia in the same way as it is trying to suppress the non-Orthodox Christian denominations,&#8221; the expert said.\n', 'next,annual,local,second,past,positive,tore,strong,Russian,large,site,sparsely,temple,concrete,temporary,respite,religious,cultural,Russian,only,religious,cultural,social,Russian,bad,difficult,ideological,many,Russian,such,aggressive,new,Russian,incomparable,several,free,poor,natural,cultural,religious,Arctic,religious,Japanese,strong,same,', ' concrete free large natural positive respite strong', ' bad difficult incomparable poor', 7, -4, 3, 11);

He also accused the inspectors of pursuing a biased approach by pointing out that they had disregarded samples that the Syrian government had collected from a succession of &#8220;tragic episodes&#8221;, which apparently took place between August 21-24.\n&#8220;This is new material &#8212; new material for us. But this is not already completely new material for the U.N.,&#8221; observed Mr. Ryabkov referring to fresh evidence provided by the Syrian government, which Moscow has now pledged to highlight at the U.N. Security Council.\n&#8220;This material was discreetly handed over to Ake Salstrom, the head of the U.N. mission of experts here [in Syria] which came to investigate the Ghouta incidents. [Mr.] Salstrom was asked to look into it and eventually factor this new evidence into the final report. \nIt never happened in fact,&#8221; said Mr. Ryabkov. &#8220;This is one of the reasons why we criticise the speed with which the report was released&#8230; and also an incomplete content of this report&#8221;.\nAs the Russians built a case that was likely to strengthen the Syrian government&#8217;s hand, the growing dominance of al-Qaeda-linked groups in the Syrian opposition has come to the fore yet again. After fierce fighting, the al-Qaeda affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has routed the so called &#8220;moderate&#8221; western- backed FSA in a highly sensitive zone between Turkey and Aleppo , Syria&#8217;s largest city, as well as its commercial capital, which has rapidly assumed the appearance a scarred battlefield. \nThe ISIS militants have overrun the Syrian town of A&#8217;zaz near the Turkish border, following fierce clashes with the FSA. \nAt least five FSA cadres were killed and another 100 detained in the town. \nHeavy clashes between the ISIS and the FSA have also been reported in the Al-Bab city, northeast of Aleppo. \nAnalysts say that the growing assertion of al-Qaeda-affiliated groups, comprising mostly of foreign fighters, bolsters the government&#8217;s argument that after over two years of fighting, the revolt in Syria has morphed into a proxy-war, waged by foreign powers. \nIt is also an indictment of the decision by western governments to arm the opposition, as the supplied weapons are likely to fall in the hands of the al-Qaeda affiliates, further inflaming terrorism in the region.\nCoinciding with this, Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad is leading from the front by engaging in a sophisticated media campaign involving American television channels. \nAfter his interview with Charlie Rose on CBS news, the Syrian President has now reached out to the hawkish Fox News network \nHe told the channel on Wednesday that he was committed to the Geneva agreement between Russia and the United States, which paves the way for the destruction of Syria&#8217;s inventory of chemical weapons. \n&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a very complicated operation, technically. And it needs a lot of money, about a billion [dollars],&#8221; he said. \n&#8220;So it depends, you have to ask the experts what they mean by quickly. It has a certain schedule. It needs a year, or maybe a little bit more,&#8221; observed the President. \nThe President also advised his U.S. counterpart, Barack Obama to &#8220;follow the common sense&#8221; of his people, who are overwhelmingly opposed to a military strike against Syria.', 'political,diplomatic,responsible,chemical,biased,new,new,new,fresh,new,final,incomplete,likely,sensitive,commercial,foreign,foreign,western,likely,sophisticated,American,hawkish,chemical,certain,common,military,', ' diplomatic fresh responsible sensitive sophisticated', ' biased hawkish incomplete', 5, -3, 2, 8),

These included investigation into the March 19 incident in Khan al-Assal, a town on the outskirts of Aleppo, Syria&#8217;s largest city.\n\n\nMr. Jaafari stressed that the release of the incomplete report has served the interventionist agenda of some countries, which seek to politicise the probe and demonise the Syrian government.

Syria now has to remove or destroy its entire stockpile of chemical weapons by mid-2014, or face a United Nations resolution enforcing the agreement with the threat of force in the event of non-compliance. Yet, the deal could be undermined by the conflicting and shifting alliances and interests among all the West Asian countries involved.\n\n\nAt least one of the alliances or collaborations remains unlikely. Had President Barack Obama sent U.S. troops to Syria, they would have found themselves on the same side as the extreme Sunni faction Jabhat al Nusra, which has links to al-Qaeda. This prospect may not have occurred to hawkish Congressional Republicans demanding war, but veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions are very angry about it.\n\n\nAmong the actual collaborations, one took place in Washington when Mr. Obama &#8212; who has never been publicly supportive of the Zionist lobby in the United States and whose administration has criticised Israel&#8217;s illegal settlements in the occupied territories &#8212; had a long conference call with, among other bodies, the lobby&#8217;s best-known group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), after which AIPAC mounted a strong but fruitless campaign asking members of Congress to vote for military intervention in Syria.\n\n\nThe other alliances are only too real. Certain West Asian countries have been putting pressure on Washington to use force against Syria; Secretary of State John Kerry says there is support from Saudi Arabia for a strike, and from Qatar for foreign intervention. Various countries in the region have also offered to pay for a U.S.-led invasion of Syria.\n\n\nThe rulers concerned, neither propose to invade Syria themselves, nor do they seek U.N. intervention &#8212; their aims go beyond removing the Syrian regime. They are deeply troubled by the Arab awakening, which has undermined their entire sense of order in the region, with some peculiar consequences. Saudi Arabia is directing its current aid specifically to al-Qaeda allies al Nusra and not to the whole Syrian National Coalition.\n\n\nFurthermore, many West Asian countries are much more fearful about Iran than they are about Syria, and particularly fear the kind of influence they think Iran might wield in the region, either on its own or through Shia movements in Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Needless to say, the West Asian monarchies and dictatorships consider the Assad government, which is made up almost exclusively of the country&#8217;s Alawite Shia minority, to be nothing but Iranian clients.\n\n\nThe same holds for Israel, often thought to be the greatest U.S. ally in West Asia and the strongest regional influence on Washington. Yet, this influence is not all it might seem to be; the Zionist lobby cannot control any U.S. President who is determined to speak directly to the public, especially over matters of national interest. Second, even within Israel there are significant differences between the U.S. Zionist lobby and Israeli concerns. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has been uncharacteristically quiet about Syria and has asked his cabinet to follow suit, possibly because comments could put Mr. Obama off intervening. Furthermore, within Israel a wide range of views obtains. The daily <i>Haaretz</i>, in an editorial on September 10, states that AIPAC has every right to express its views and to lobby in the U.S., but that AIPAC is not Israel and has no right to &#8220;express Israeli policy&#8221; &#8212; or to &#8220;send others to conduct military operations, much less in the indirect service of the Syrian rebels and Al-Qaida.&#8221;\n\n\nThird, the strength of Saudi Arabian influence on Washington is often underestimated. Riyadh has no organised lobby there, but it is one of the biggest buyers of U.S. weaponry &#8212; an important matter for elected officials whose seats could depend on employment levels in their own constituencies &#8212; and has extensive networks among the military and intelligence services. Furthermore, Saudi Arabian arms purchases put a proportion of oil profits back into the U.S. economy, and the oil majors have themselves long made enormous sums from their operations in the kingdom.\n\n\nIt is here that the most startling confluence of concerns emerges. Israel fears that if the Syrian regime surrenders or destroys its chemical weapons, Mr. Assad will be strengthened; that in turn would help both Iran and Hezbollah, which has sent troops to help the Assad forces. Saudi Arabia almost certainly feels the same, if for primarily sectarian reasons and for fear of losing its relative dominance among the Muslim-majority countries in the region. Tel Aviv and Riyadh may want the Syrian regime removed, but they do not want a democracy instead, either there or elsewhere in West Asia, because that would bring challenges to their own legitimacy as well as public demands that they actively work towards a just and equitable solution in Israel-Palestine. In effect, the strongest potential collaboration here is that between the hardline Salafist monarchy of Saudi Arabia and the Zionist state of Israel. That might give satirists or <i>farceurs </i>good material, but any graphic representation of the situation would probably look like a painting by Maurits Cornelis Escher or Salvador DalÃ­.

The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said calls for an immediate chapter VII resolution showed a &#8220;lack of understanding&#8221; of Saturday&#8217;s Geneva agreement with the U.S. about the process of declaring, inspecting and dismantling Syria&#8217;s chemical weapons. \n\nAny resolution this week cannot include chapter VII, Mr. Lavrov insisted. &#8220;I am certain that despite the statements we are hearing from certain European capitals, the American side will firmly adhere to what was agreed,&#8221; the Russian Foreign Minister said. \n\nHe was reacting to reports from a meeting in Paris between the U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry; the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius; and the U.K. Foreign Secretary, William Hague, who declared themselves united behind a tough U.N. resolution to put the Geneva agreement into practice. \n\n&#8220;We want concrete, verifiable acts and all options must stay on the table if these are not done,&#8221; Mr. Fabius said.

The deal &#8212; signed Saturday in Geneva by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his U.S. counterpart John Kerry &#8212; requires Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to allow for immediate &#8220;on-site inspections of all declared sites&#8221; which produce and stockpile chemical munitions. The agreement proposes to &#8220;eliminate&#8221; all WMD material in Syria within the &#8220;first half of 2014.&#8221; With Syria having formally acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the inspection will be supervised by the treaty&#8217;s watchdog, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as well as the U.N. These remarkable developments, which come barely a week after a West-led attack on Syria seemed all but inevitable, represent a stunning victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who urged the U.S. via an op-ed in the <i>New York Times</i> to &#8220;stop using the language of force and return to the path of [...] diplomatic settlement.&#8221; His attempt marks one of the most politically savvy gestures by a head of state to reach across the aisle to a foreign audience in recent years. \n\nSaturday&#8217;s deal is a game-changer in more ways than one. On the one hand, it could prevent further escalation of violence, including the use of WMDs, in Syria. On the other, weapons inspection necessitates a cease-fire agreement between the government and the rebels in many parts of the country, which can only help the case for political dialogue. That said, the power struggle between the U.S. and Russia on this issue will continue unabated. If the West has been saved the blushes of going to war without domestic support, it will now exploit any claim of Syria&#8217;s non-compliance to initiate a military strike. Moscow seems amenable to a Chapter VII resolution at the U.N. Security Council to goad Syria into cooperating, but will insist on a tight draft that eschews the use of force against Assad&#8217;s regime. Syria&#8217;s accession to the CWC leaves Israel and Egypt, staunch American allies, as the only two holdouts in the region to remain outside major treaties banning WMDs.

Mr. Kerry said that the inspectors belonging to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the UN and other supporting staff must be provided &#8220;with the immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites in Syria&#8221;.\n\n\nThe official Syrian news agency SANA is quoting Mr. Lavrov as saying that he hoped that the resolution of the chemical weapons issue in Syria would be "an important step towards establishing a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction"&#8212;a move that would also cover the elimination of Israel&#8217;s atomic weapon stockpiles. Analysts say that a zone free of mass destruction weapons in West Asia would encourage Syria to cooperate as it had accumulated chemical weapons to deter a nuclear armed Israel.\n\n\nThe disposal of Syria&#8217;s chemical weapons stockpiles will take place under the embedded guidelines of the Chemical Weapons Convention, said Mr. Kerry. A part of Syria&#8217;s arsenal would be destroyed inside the country while the rest will be eliminated abroad.\n\n\nUnder the plan, the Syrian government has been given one week to handover the inventory of its chemical weapons arsenal. Mr. Kerry said that the deal covers not only the destruction of weapons but also capabilities to produce and refine chemical arms. He stressed that Syria has to provide &#8220;names, types, and quantities of its chemical weapons agents, types of munitions, and location and form of storage, production and research and development facilities." In turn, Syria will become a member of the OPCW, which outlaws the production and use of these arms.\n\n\nDuring their deliberations, Russian and U.S. experts had arrived at a shared estimate of the size of the Syrian arsenal.\n\n\nMr. Lavrov said that the Syrian government and the opposition were jointly responsible for the security of inspectors who would hit the ground in the next few weeks.\n\n\n"Our proposals say that the Syrian authorities bear primary responsibility for [international experts''] security, but not only them but also other Syrian parties, that is, the opposition, will have to be responsible for eliminating threats to the international personnel," said that Russian top diplomat.\n\n\nHe also traced the breakthrough that was achieved in Geneva to the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Barack Obama during the recently concluded meeting of G-20 nations in St. Petersburg. &#8220;The goal, which was established in the conversation between our presidents on Friday September 6 during the G20 in Saint Petersburg, has been reached,&#8221; said Mr. Lavrov. \n\nMr. Kerry too acknowledged that the Russian initiative, reciprocated by President Obama, had paved the way to Saturday&#8217;s deal. &#8220;President Putin, to his credit, despite real disagreement with our policy&#8230; reached out and tried to continue the dialogue,&#8221; said Mr. Kerry. &#8220;I am pleased that President Putin took initiative, and Sergei [Lavrov] took the initiative, and that President [Barack] Obama responded.&#8221; \n\nDespite covering considerable common ground, Moscow and Washington, differed significantly on the role that the Security Council would play if the Syrian government failed to strictly abide by the provisions of the agreement. While the Russians were clear that the Syrians cannot be penalised under Chapter VII provisions of the UN charter that allow the use of force, the Americans thought otherwise. \n\nMr. Kerry said that Chapter VII provisions could be invoked that allow "action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security" in the event other measures fail.\n\n\nRussia has insisted that it visualises its initiative to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria as a stepping stone to a comprehensive dialogue under the Geneva-2 framework to peacefully end the over two-year old conflict in the Levantine state.\n\n\n&#8220;We stressed with John Kerry that we insist on the peaceful solution, and we held a meeting with [UN Envoy to Syria] Lakhdar Brahimi and we talked about these issues," said Mr. Lavrov. The Russian foreign minister hoped that the opposition would also reciprocate the Syrian government&#8217;s decision to participate in the Geneva-2 deliberations, without preconditions.\n\n\nMeanwhile a senior Russian lawmaker has said that the timelines imposed on the Syrian government under the Moscow-Washington deal to declare its arsenal were unrealistic. &#8220;The demand by the United States to hand over chemical weapons to international control in two or three weeks is simply unprofessional," said Alexei Pushkov, the head of the Russian parliament''s foreign affairs committee. \n\n"In Syria there are at least 42 storage facilities, some of them in battle zones," he wrote on Twitter.\n', 'intensive,timetable,chemical,chemical,Russian,other,immediate,chemical,important,free,atomic,free,chemical,nuclear,arsenal,chemical,chemical,responsible,next,few,bear,primary,international,other,Syrian,responsible,international,Russian,breakthrough,real,reached,initiative,initiative,considerable,common,clear,allow,necessary,international,other,initiative,chemical,comprehensive,old,peaceful,foreign,senior,Russian,arsenal,chemical,international,unprofessional,Russian,foreign,', ' breakthrough comprehensive free important necessary peaceful real responsible', '', 8, 0, 8, 8);

We discussed some of the homework that we both need to do,&#8221; Mr. Kerry said. \n\nMr. Kerry said they agreed to meet around Sept. 28 on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly high-level meetings in New York. But, he said, the future of peace negotiations depends on the outcome of the weapons talks. \n\n&#8220;And we are committed to try to work together, beginning with this initiative on the chemical weapons, in hopes that those efforts could pay off and bring peace and stability to a war-torn part of the world,&#8221; he added. \n\nMr. Brahimi also met privately with Mr. Kerry at a Geneva hotel on Thursday to explore ways to resume international negotiations last held in Geneva in June 2012 aimed at ending the Syrian civil war. \n\nMr. Lavrov said Russia has supported the peace process from the start of the Syrian conflict but that &#8220;it is very unfortunate that for a long period the Geneva communique was basically abandoned.&#8221; \n\nMr. Lavrov said he, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Brahimi discussed ways of preparing for a second conference along with the document, which &#8220;means that the Syrian parties must reach mutual consent on the transitional governing organ, which would come with full executive authority. And the communiquÃ© also says that all groups of Syrian society must be represented.&#8221; \n\nWhen the talks began on Thursday, Mr. Kerry bluntly rejected a Syrian pledge to begin a &#8220;standard process&#8221; by turning over information rather than weapons and nothing immediately. The American diplomat said that was not acceptable. \n\n&#8220;The words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough,&#8221; Mr. Kerry declared as he stood beside Mr. Lavrov. &#8220;This is not a game.&#8221; \n\nThe talks were the latest in a rapidly moving series of events following the Aug. 21 gas attack on suburbs in Damascus. The U.S. blames Syrian President Bashar Assad for the use of chemical weapons, although Mr. Assad denies his government was involved and instead points to rebels engaged in a 2-year-old civil war against his government. \n\nPresident Barack Obama began building a case for support at home and abroad for a punitive military strike on Mr. Assad&#8217;s forces, then changed course and asked Congress to give him explicit authority for a limited strike. With the campaign for lawmakers&#8217; building to a vote one that he might well lose Obama said on Tuesday he would consider a Russian proposal calling for international control of Assad&#8217;s chemical weapons and their eventual destruction. \n\nMr. Obama dispatched Mr. Kerry to Geneva to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of U.S. military action. \n\n&#8220;We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,&#8221; Mr. Kerry said on the opening day of talks. The turnover of weapons must be complete, verifiable and timely, he said, &#8220;and, finally, there ought to be consequences if it doesn&#8217;t take place.&#8221; \n\nMr. Lavrov seemed to contradict Mr. Kerry&#8217;s negative view of Mr. Assad&#8217;s offer to provide details on his country&#8217;s chemical arsenal beginning 30 days after it signs an international convention banning such weapons. Syria&#8217;s ambassador to the United Nations said that as of Thursday his country had become a full member of the treaty, which requires destruction of all chemical weapons. \n\nThe Russian said the initiative must proceed &#8220;in strict compliance with the rules that are established by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.&#8221; That suggests Russia does not agree with the U.S. that this is an exceptional case and that Syria should face tougher standards than other countries. \n\n&#8220;We proceed from the fact that the solution to this problem will make unnecessary any strike on the Syrian Arab Republic, and I am convinced that our American colleagues, as President Obama stated, are firmly convinced that we should follow a peaceful way of resolution to the conflict in Syria,&#8221; Mr. Lavrov said. \n\nThe distrust in U.S.-Russia relations was on display even in an off-hand parting exchange at the news conference. Just before it ended, Mr. Kerry asked the Russian translator to repeat part of Mr. Lavrov&#8217;s concluding remarks. \n\nWhen it was clear that Mr. Kerry wasn&#8217;t going to get an immediate retranslation, Mr. Lavrov apparently tried to assure him that he hadn&#8217;t said anything controversial. &#8220;It was OK, John, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said. \n\n&#8220;You want me to take your word for it?&#8221; Mr. Kerry asked Mr. Lavrov. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little early for that.&#8221; \n\nThey were smiling at that point. Shortly after making their opening statements, the two went into a private dinner. \n\nMr. Assad, in an interview with Russia&#8217;s Rossiya-24 TV, said his government would start submitting data on its chemical weapons stockpile a month after signing the convention. He also said the Russian proposal for securing the weapons could work only if the U.S. halted threats of military action. \n\nAt a meeting in Kyrgyzstan of an international security grouping dominated by Russia and China, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Syria&#8217;s efforts have demonstrated its good faith. \n\n&#8220;I would like to voice hope that this will mark a serious step toward the settlement of the Syrian crisis,&#8221; Mr. Putin said. \n\nEven as diplomacy took center stage, word surfaced that the CIA has been delivering light machine guns and other small arms to Syrian rebels for several weeks, following Mr. Obama&#8217;s statement in June that he would provide lethal aid to the rebels. \n\nWhite House National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said the administration could not &#8220;detail every single type of support that we are providing to the opposition or discuss timelines for delivery, but it&#8217;s important to note that both the political and the military opposition are and will be receiving this assistance.&#8221; \n\nCurrent and former U.S. intelligence officials said the CIA has arranged for the Syrian opposition to receive anti-tank weaponry such as rocket-propelled grenades through a third party, presumably one of the Gulf countries that have been arming the rebels. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the classified program publicly. \n\nLoay al-Mikdad, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army, told <i>The Associated Press</i> that his group expected to receive weapons in the near future.

The UN welcomed the move, but said that it could take 30 days for Syria to become a member. \n\nRussia proposed on Monday that Syria surrenders control over its chemical weapons to the international community for its eventual dismantling to avoid a US military strike, and Damascus quickly jumped at the offer. \n\n<b>US, Russia still apart </b>\n\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov were to discuss a time line for eventually destroying Syria&#8217;s chemical weapons stockpile in a second day of talks in Geneva on Friday, diplomats said. \n\nThe men need to work out differences between the US and Russia on how to rid Syria of its chemical weapons after failing to agree on several points in a first day of talks, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n\nThe talks could run into the weekend, they added. \n\nAs Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov started their meetings on Thursday evening, the United Nations confirmed in New York that Syria had applied to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, the treaty that obliges its members to give up such weapons. \n\nThe US wants the chemical disarmament plan to be accompanied by a threat of punitive measures, which would be contained in a UN Security Council resolution, in case Mr. al-Assad does not follow through on his promises, the diplomats said. \n\nHowever, Russia opposes such a resolution, they said. \n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad told Russian state television on Thursday that he would not disarm unless the United States stopped threatening to attack his country. \n\nMr. Kerry stressed the need to maintain a military option in a meeting with the Syria envoy of the UN and Arab League, Lakhdar Brahimi, in Geneva on Thursday, diplomatic sources said.

(379, '1979', 'September 13, 2013', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/from-russia-a-plea-for-caution/article5120953.ece', '\nRecent events surrounding Syria have prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders. It is important to do so at a time of insufficient communication between our societies. \n\nRelations between us have passed through different stages. We stood against each other during the Cold War. But we were also allies once, and defeated the Nazis together. The universal international organisation &#8212; the United Nations &#8212; was then established to prevent such devastation from ever happening again. \n\nThe United Nations&#8217; founders understood that decisions affecting war and peace should happen only by consensus, and with America&#8217;s consent the veto by Security Council permanent members was enshrined in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">United Nations Charter</a>. The profound wisdom of this has underpinned the stability of international relations for decades. \n\nNo one wants the United Nations to suffer the fate of the League of Nations, which collapsed because it lacked real leverage. This is possible if influential countries bypass the United Nations and take military action without Security Council authorisation. \n\nThe potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the Pope, will result in more innocent victims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria&#8217;s borders. A strike would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism. It could undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilise the Middle East and North Africa. It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance. \n\nSyria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multireligious country. There are few champions of democracy in Syria. But there are more than enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government. The United States State Department has designated Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, fighting with the opposition, as terrorist organisations. This internal conflict, fuelled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition, is one of the bloodiest in the world. \n\nMercenaries from Arab countries fighting there, and hundreds of militants from Western countries and even Russia, are an issue of our deep concern. Might they not return to our countries with experience acquired in Syria? After all, after fighting in Libya, extremists moved on to Mali. This threatens us all. \n\nFrom the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future. We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law. We need to use the United Nations Security Council and believe that preserving law and order in today&#8217;s complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos. The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not. Under current international law, force is permitted only in self-defence or by the decision of the Security Council. Anything else is unacceptable under the United Nations Charter and would constitute an act of aggression. \n\nNo one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports that militants are preparing another attack &#8212; this time against Israel &#8212; cannot be ignored. \n\nIt is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America&#8217;s long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan &#8220;you&#8217;re either with us or against us.&#8221; \n\nBut force has proved ineffective and pointless. Afghanistan is reeling, and no one can say what will happen after international forces withdraw. Libya is divided into tribes and clans. In Iraq the civil war continues, with dozens killed each day. In the United States, many draw an analogy between Iraq and Syria, and ask why their government would want to repeat recent mistakes. \n\nNo matter how targeted the strikes or how sophisticated the weapons, civilian casualties are inevitable, including the elderly and children, whom the strikes are meant to protect. \n\nThe world reacts by asking: if you cannot count on international law, then you must find other ways to ensure your security. Thus a growing number of countries seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction. This is logical: if you have the bomb, no one will touch you. We are left with talk of the need to strengthen non-proliferation, when in reality this is being eroded. \n\nWe must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilised diplomatic and political settlement. \n\nA new opportunity to avoid military action has emerged in the past few days. The United States, Russia and all members of the international community must take advantage of the Syrian government&#8217;s willingness to place its chemical arsenal under international control for subsequent destruction. Judging by the statements of <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/cautious-obama-delays-strike-as-syria-agrees-on-russian-plan/article5115465.ece">President Obama</a>, the United States sees this as an alternative to military action. \n\nI welcome the President&#8217;s interest in continuing the dialogue with Russia on Syria. We must work together to keep this hope alive, as we agreed to at the Group of 8 meeting in Lough Erne in Northern Ireland in June, and steer the discussion back toward negotiations. \n\nIf we can avoid force against Syria, this will improve the atmosphere in international affairs and strengthen mutual trust. It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other critical issues. \n\nMy working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. I appreciate this. I carefully studied his address to the nation on Tuesday. And I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States&#8217; policy is &#8220;what makes America different. It&#8217;s what makes us exceptional.&#8221; It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord&#8217;s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal. <b>&#8212; New York Times News Service </b>\n\n\n<i>(Vladimir V.

We intend to give up chemical weapons altogether.&#8221;\n\n\nSyria&#8217;s positive affirmation of compliance is likely to impart fresh impetus to the use of diplomacy rather than force. In a major public address on Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama announced his agreement to explore international diplomacy instead of military intervention; an assertion that marked a dramatic turnaround in position following Russia&#8217;s call to seek an end to Syrian chemical weapons through talks.\n\n\nAnalysts point out that Moscow&#8217;s move could eventually bail Mr. Obama out of a sticky predicament. Without an exit route, like the one provided by Russia, Mr. Obama could have found himself confronting a politically embarrassing defeat in Congress &#8212; in no mood endorse his call for limited strikes against Syria. He has now urged Congress to defer its vote.\n\n\nSimultaneously, he has agreed to address the Syrian crisis in the U.N. Security Council &#8212; a proposition that he had been firmly rejecting since August 21, when chemical weapons were allegedly used to kill hundreds of people in the outskirts of Damascus.\n\n\nGauging the rapidly evolving situation, including the presidential climbdown, U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel observed during a testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that it would now not be possible to launch military strikes against Syria before mid-October.\n\n\nAs the terrain shifted towards dialogue, it became evident that a lot of groundwork would be required before convergence between the western powers and Russia, backed by China, can be achieved. \n\nIn New York, the Russians want the Security Council to issue a presidential statement, which precludes any reference to the use of force, to seek Syrian compliance to complete disarmament. \n\nMoscow&#8217;s proposal entrusts the United Nations Secretary-General and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) &#8212; the organisation that oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention &#8212; to implement a plan that would establish international control over Syria&#8217;s arsenal. \n\nOn its part, France has insisted that demands from Syria should be packaged within chapter VII provisions, implying that non-compliance by Damascus could be met with a military response.\n\n\nCritics of the Russian initiative are also pointing to the practical difficulties of ridding Syria of chemical weapons, which are apparently spread across multiple locations, including territories that are under the opposition&#8217;s control. \n\nObservers say enforcement of a comprehensive ceasefire is likely to become a core element of a deal to verifiably destroy Syria&#8217;s chemical weapons stockpile.\n\n\nAware that a rocky road still lay ahead, Mr. Obama is sending his Secretary of State John Kerry to Geneva for crucial talks with the latter&#8217;s Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.

Mr. Putin, a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, said this discussion with Mr. Obama focussed on Syria during the 20 to 30 minutes and that, while they disagreed, the meeting was &#8220;substantial and constructive.&#8221; \n\nMr. Obama said he had a &#8220;candid and constructive conversation&#8221; with Mr. Putin, even if they still disagreed on how to respond to the chemical weapons use in Syria. He said they agreed the underlying conflict can only be resolved through a political transition. Mr. Obama said he thinks it is important that he and Mr. Putin work together to urge all sides in the conflict to try to resolve it. \n\nThe meeting came on Friday as Mr. Obama sought to build international backing for military action. But three days after he left Washington, it&#8217;s unclear whether the global coalition the president has been seeking is any closer to becoming a reality. \n\nPutting up stiff resistance to Mr. Obama&#8217;s appeals, Russia on Friday warned the United States and its allies against striking any chemical weapon storage facilities in Syria. The Russian Foreign Ministry said such targeting could release toxic chemicals and give militants or terrorist access to chemical weapons. \n\n&#8220;This is a step toward proliferation of chemical weapons not only across the Syrian territory but beyond its borders,&#8221; the Russian statement said. \n\nMoreover, China remained a firm no. The European Union is skeptical about whether any military action can be effective. Even Pope Francis weighed in, urging leaders gathered here to abandon what he called a &#8220;futile mission.&#8221; \n\nStill, Mr. Obama was undeterred. He and French President Francois Hollande, the U.S.&#8217;s strongest ally on Syria and a vocal advocate for a military intervention, met on the sidelines of the summit about attracting European support for action. &#8220;It&#8217;s clear that there are many countries that agree with us that international norms must be upheld,&#8221; Obama said. \n\n&#8220;To do nothing would mean impunity,&#8221; Hollande said. &#8220;We must take our responsibility&#8221; and act. \n\nAs the President pressed his case on the world stage, he was dispatching his U.N. ambassador, Samantha Power, to a Washington think tank to argue that the global community cannot afford the precedent of letting chemical weapons use go unpunished. \n\nIllustrating the risks associated with a strike, however, the State Department on Friday ordered nonessential U.S. diplomats to leave Lebanon, a step under consideration since Obama said he was contemplating military action against the Syrian regime last week. The travel warning said it had instructed nonessential staffers to leave Beirut and urged private American citizens to depart Lebanon. \n\nYet even as Mr. Obama sought the global buy-in that could legitimise a potential strike, his aides were careful to temper expectations that the world community could speak with one voice. Mr. Obama&#8217;s Deputy National Security Adviser, Ben Rhodes, said the President wasn&#8217;t asking his peers to pledge their own militaries to a U.S.-led strike, but simply to say they agree a military response is warranted. \n\n&#8220;We don&#8217;t expect every country here to agree with that position,&#8221; Mr. Rhodes said Friday at the Group of 20 economic summit, where Mr. Obama was huddling with foreign leaders. \n\nStanding on Russian soil, Mr. Rhodes suggested the U.S. had given up hope that Russia a stalwart Syria ally could be coerced into changing its position. &#8220;We don&#8217;t expect to have Russian cooperation,&#8221; he said. \n\nA key status update was to come Friday when Mr. Obama, his diplomatic dexterity pushed to the max, will be quizzed by reporters in the waning hours of the summit. \n\nA jobs-and-growth agenda awaiting world leaders gathering at the ornate Constantine Palace quickly gave way to intense posturing over Syria at least on the surface. The leaders served up Syria as dinner conversation on Thursday at the suggestion of the summit&#8217;s host, Mr. Putin. The Russian leader has steadfastly backed Mr. Assad and disputes claims that the Syrian regime was behind chemical attacks that the U.S. says killed more than 1,400 Syrians. Other estimates are lower. \n\nSyria dominated the nearly three-hour meal, with leaders condemning the use of chemical weapons but reaching no consensus about the proper response, said a French official in St. Petersburg. Many leaders at the dinner remained in doubt about whether Mr. Assad&#8217;s regime was behind the attack, said the official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to presidential policy. \n\nSo too was the Syrian crisis a prevailing theme in Obama&#8217;s individual meetings with world leaders on the sidelines of the summit in this Russian port city. \n\nThe White House said Obama conferred on Syria Thursday evening with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a strong supporter of airstrikes against the nation on its southern border. Syria also came up on Friday as Mr. Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose government has warned vigorously against the use of force. \n\nBefore his scheduled return to Washington late Friday, Mr. Obama also planned to meet with Russian lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists, calling attention to another area of disagreement with Moscow. \n\nA fleeting interaction between Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin became the high-drama moment of the summit, underscoring the laboured state of relations between the two leaders. The eyes of the world watching, the Russian and the American were all smiles on Thursday as they made small talk in front of news cameras for a few seconds as Mr. Obama arrived at the summit. \n\nBut the welcoming handshake may have been where the pleasantries ended. In other venues, the two nations were repeatedly bumping heads. \n\nRussia&#8217;s Foreign Ministry, in a statement on Friday, said a U.S.-led strike would mark &#8220;a new dangerous turn&#8221; in the crisis, risking the release of chemical weapons or their possession by terrorists. And the head of the foreign affairs panel in Russia&#8217;s lower house of parliament, Alexei Pushkov, blasted Mr. Obama on Twitter as having &#8220;completely transformed into a president of war.&#8221; \n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin said Russia was boosting its naval presence in the Mediterranean Sea, moving in warships into the area and stoking fears about a larger international conflict if the United States orders airstrikes. \n\nEven at home, there was far from a consensus that an American strike on Syria was the best course of action. Awaiting Mr. Obama upon his return was an equally fractious debate in Congress over whether to authorize the limited military action he was proposing. \n\nPulling out all the stops, Mr. Obama was working the phones from Europe and appealing for support from leery legislators, Democratic and Republican alike. And he called off a planned trip to California next week, opting to stay in Washington to keep up the pressure on Congress to say yes. \n\nAs top national security officials continued to brief Congress on the accusation against Mr. Assad and the proposed response, a measure authorising Mr. Obama to act was advancing tenuously through the Senate, winning approval from a foreign relations panel Wednesday and heading to the Senate floor. The measure&#8217;s prospects were less certain in the Republican-controlled House. \n\nIn an unusual turn of events, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner both said that a delegation of Russian lawmakers had sought to meet with them to discuss Syria. Both leaders, who are supporting Mr. Obama&#8217;s call for a strike, turned down that invitation, aides said. \n\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that the Russians have anything to add to the debate in the United States, given that we know where Russia stands,&#8221; said Mr. Rhodes, the Obama aide.\n', 'foreign,chemical,military,right,much,possible,economic,other,many,foreign,military,Russian,military,constructive,chemical,political,important,international,military,global,stiff,chemical,such,toxic,chemical,chemical,Russian,skeptical,military,vocal,military,European,many,international,global,chemical,nonessential,military,last,nonessential,private,American,global,potential,careful,own,military,economic,foreign,Russian,key,diplomatic,chemical,chemical,French,presidential,individual,Russian,Turkish,strong,Chinese,Russian,lesbian,bisexual,laboured,small,few,other,new,dangerous,chemical,foreign,international,fractious,military,Democratic,next,top,national,brief,foreign,certain,unusual,', ' careful constructive democratic diplomatic important potential right strong top', ' dangerous fractious skeptical stiff toxic unusual', 9, -6, 3, 15),

But he strongly warned Washington against launching unilateral attack against Syria.\n\n\n&#8220;In line with international law, the U.N.

The Associated Press, quoting a White House official, reported that Mr. Obama has agreed to discuss Moscow&#8217;s proposal in the U.N. Security Council, with the aim of ensuring that the Syrian government surrenders its stocks of chemical weapons.\n\n\nThe President apparently took the decision in consultation with British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande.\n\n\nAfter Russia announced its proposal, the U.S. Senate decided it would delay voting &#8212; earlier scheduled for Wednesday &#8212; on endorsing Mr. Obama&#8217;s decision to attack Syria.

The assault has spotlighted fears among Syria&#8217;s religious minorities about the prominent role of Islamic extremists in the rebel ranks fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assad&#8217;s regime. \nThe government forces sent to Maaloula have taken up positions outside the village, which is still under the control of local pro-regime militias, said Rami Abdul-Rahman, the director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He said that there were skirmishes on Friday around the village, which is home to two of the oldest surviving monasteries in Syria &#8212; Mar Sarkis and Mar Takla. \nThe assault is being spearheaded by Jabhat al-Nusra, one of the most effective rebel factions and a group the United States has deemed a terrorist organisation. The group includes Syrians as well as foreign fighters from across the Muslim world. \nThe Syrian Government has tried to emphasize the role of foreigners fighting on the rebel side as part of its narrative that the Assad regime is battling a foreign-backed conspiracy. \nIn that vein, Syrian state television said on Friday that the Government is offering 500,000 Syrian pounds ($2,800) for turning in a foreign fighter, and 200,000 pounds ($1,150) for information about their whereabouts or assistance in their capture. \nAs the fighting continued on the ground inside Syria, President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration forged ahead in its efforts to win Congressional backing for military strikes against Syria over a suspected chemical attack on August 21 outside Damascus. The U.S. accuses the Assad regime of being behind the attack, while Syria blames the rebels. \nMr. Obama was on Friday expected to use the last day of the Group of 20 economic summit in Russia to continue his quest to scrounge up foreign support for armed action. He has had little public success so far, with only France willing to take part in any military response. \nThe summit&#8217;s host, Russia, is staunchly opposed to any Western action against Syria.

Details of their backgrounds have emerged from interviews with neighbours, Malaysia Airlines staff, a religious leader and from social networks and news reports in Malaysia and Australia. \n\nFariq is a &#8220;good boy, a good Muslim, humble and quiet,&#8221; said Ahmad Sarafi Ali Asrah, the head of a community mosque about 100 meters from Fariq&#8217;s two-story home in a middle class neighborhood on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. \n\n&#8220;His father still cries when he talks about Fariq. His mother too,&#8221; said Ahmad Sarafi. \n\nFariq, the son of a high-ranking civil servant in Selangor state, joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007. With just 2,763 hours of flight experience he had only recently started co-piloting the sophisticated Boeing 777. \n\nNeighbor Ayop Jantan said he had heard that Fariq was engaged and planning his wedding. The eldest of five children, his professional achievements were a source of pride for his father, said Ayop, a retiree. \n\nFariq&#8217;s superior, Zaharie, joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and has more than 18,000 flight hours. \n\nBorn in northern Penang state, the bald-headed captain and grandfather is also an enthusiastic handyman and proud home cook. As part of what he called &#8220;community service,&#8221; he had posted several YouTube videos including how to make air conditioners more efficient to cut electricity bills, how to waterproof window panes and how to repair a fridge icemaker. \n\nA Malaysian Airline stewardess who had flown with Zaharie several times said he was &#8220;very nice, very friendly and safety-conscious.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t want to be named because of company policy prohibiting employees from speaking to the media. \n\nNeighbours of both men also praised their commitment to the community. Fariq played futsal, a modified form of soccer popular in Southeast Asia, with neighborhood youngsters and paid for their sports shirts. Zaharie was known for bringing food he cooked himself to community events or making sure his wife and children did when he couldn&#8217;t attend. A supporter of Malaysia&#8217;s main opposition parties, he had volunteered to be a poll monitor in recent elections. \n\nYet both Fariq and Zaharie have quirks that reveal a more colorful side to their pilot personas. \n\nGrabbing attention were pictures Zaharie posted online of a flight simulator he had built for his home using three large computer monitors and other accessories. \n\nMalaysia Airlines has leapt to his defense. Asked at a news conference if pilots are allowed such equipment, CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said &#8220;everyone is free to do his own hobby.&#8221; \n\nZaharie is certified by Malaysia&#8217;s Department of Civil Aviation as a flight simulator examiner, according to Malaysia Airlines. \n\nFariq has drawn greatest scrutiny after the revelation he and another pilot invited two women boarding their aircraft to sit in the cockpit for a flight from Phuket, Thailand to Kuala Lumpur in 2011. \n\nDuring the flight, the pilots smoked and flirted, one of the women, South African Jonti Roo, said in an interview broadcast by Australia&#8217;s Nine Network. The claims were backed with numerous photos showing Roos and her friend posing in the cockpit and ensuing Facebook messages inviting the women to stay in Malaysia. \n\nThough initially thrilled by the experience, Roos also described it as &#8220;possibly a little bit sleazy.&#8221; \n\nMalaysia Airlines said it was shocked by the claims and investigating. \n\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he is a playboy,&#8221; said Ahmad Sarafi, the imam at the mosque Fariq prayed at. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know about his personal life.&#8221; ', 'own,psychological,satellite,respectable,religious,social,good,humble,quiet,sophisticated,professional,northern,enthusiastic,several,air,efficient,several,modified,popular,recent,colorful,large,other,such,free,own,numerous,personal,', ' colorful efficient enthusiastic free good large popular respectable sophisticated', '', 9, 0, 9, 9),

Dr. Zerbo said he asked the head of the CTBTO&#8217;s International Data Center to look at the data &#8220;and get back to me.&#8221; \n\nHe said infrasound would be the best technology to check for an explosion on the missing plane if there was a monitoring station nearby, &#8220;or the explosion is at a level or at an amplitude that it could be detected.&#8221; \n\n&#8220;There&#8217;s a possibility, it&#8217;s not absolute, that the technology like the Infrazone could be able to detect&#8221; an explosion, he said in response to a question. \n\nAcoustic waves with very low frequencies that are inaudible to the human ear are called infrasound, according to the CTBTO&#8217;s website. \n\n&#8220;Infrasound is produced by a variety of natural and man-made sources &#8212; exploding volcanoes, earthquakes, meteors, storms and auroras in the natural world; nuclear, mining and large chemical explosions, as well as aircraft and rocket launches in the man-made arena,&#8221; the CTBTO said. \n\n<b>One of four technologies used</b><br/>\n<br/>\nInfrasound monitoring is one of the four technologies used by the International Monitoring System (IMS) to verify compliance with the nuclear test ban treaty. The CTBTO said the construction of infrasound monitoring stations &#8220;has contributed to a revival of scientific interest in this technology.&#8221; \n\nThere are seismic sensors for what&#8217;s occurring underground while hydrophones listen for underwater events. For the atmosphere, there are ultra-sensitive nuclide detectors which are designed to pick up the tiniest amount of nuclear radiation. And then there are infrasound detectors. In a dramatic demonstration of their global monitoring network&#8217;s ability to hear what humans can&#8217;t, the CTBTO has posted infrasound of the asteroid which exploded over Russia last year on the Internet. Not the sound of the meteor&#8217;s explosion, but of it tearing through the atmosphere before it became a fireball raining molten rock on the Ural Mountains. \n\nThe IMS infrasound network is the only global monitoring network of its kind and when it is fully operational it will consist of 60 stations &#8220;situated strategically in 35 countries around the world,&#8221; the CTBTO said.

It is suspected to have crashed into the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. Neither the fleet of ships and rescue vessels nor aircraft pressed into an emergency search operation has located any sign of wreckage at sea, except for an oil slick. The Malaysian authorities have taken the initiative to start an international investigation. With five of the 239 passengers and crew killed in the crash being Indians, the DGCA is also joining the probe. The one disturbing evidence on Day 1 of the investigation was that two of the passengers were travelling on fake, probably stolen, passports. But the authorities do not want to jump to the conclusion that it was an act of terrorism. The Boeing 777 has earned a reputation as a safe long-haul aircraft. After the 2013 Asiana Airlines crash, this is only the second tragedy involving this aircraft type in the nearly two decades it has been in operation. Malaysian Airlines will certainly want to get to the bottom of this tragedy in order to maintain its reputation for safety in a very competitive environment. Given the close cooperation in the Southeast Asian region, all the countries are pooling their resources to find the cause of the crash.\n\n\nThe only premise the investigators have begun with is that the end was &#8220;sudden and violent.&#8221; There was no report of bad weather and the aircraft was cruising at about 35,000 feet above sea level. The pilots did not radio for help and there was no emergency bleep. The plane just vanished from the radar hardly an hour after take-off. There is also the theory that it tried to turn back to Malaysia. Experts have offered several explanations. First on their list was structural failure in the fuselage, which could result in the splitting up of the body. The second was bad weather, of which there is no evidence. Was it an act of terror? And finally, could it have been the rare case of human failure or a suicidal streak? Until the debris is recovered, the investigation cannot proceed. Aviation experts are of the view that the size of the debris spread could provide a useful starting point for any serious investigation. That could give an indication whether the aircraft suffered an explosion, got split in the air, or just plunged into the sea and broke up. Once that is known, the investigators could proceed with a particular line of enquiry. Since there are no survivors, nothing can be verified as such. It is in the interests of all airlines, passengers and aircraft manufacturers to uncover the mystery behind this unfortunate tragedy and draw the lessons.\n', 'Malaysian,initiative,international,second,competitive,bad,several,structural,second,bad,suicidal,useful,serious,particular,', ' competitive useful', ' bad serious suicidal', 2, -3, -1, 5),

Chinese officials conveyed the desire during last month&#8217;s 17th round of boundary talks in New Delhi, sources familiar with the initial discussions said.\nThe details of the visit had not been fully finalised, and would be done so only after the Lok Sabha elections, the sources said.\nBeijing, for its part, has made clear it is keen to establish a good rapport and take ties forward with the new government that comes to power, regardless of the outcome of the elections.\nAs is the custom with visits to India by the top leadership, Mr. Xi is also expected to travel to Pakistan. It is understood that he is also considering a visit to Sri Lanka in what would be the highest profile visit by a top Chinese leader to the country in many years.\nThe visit of Mr. Xi, who travelled to India many years earlier as a provincial leader, would be the most significant by any Chinese leader to India in many years.\nSince taking over as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and head of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) in November 2012, Mr. Xi has surprised observers with the speed with which he has accumulated power.\nHe has emerged as the most powerful leader since former Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping, exerting direct influence over foreign policy, security issues and the economy in a way his predecessor Hu Jintao could not.\nWhile Mr. Hu delegated economic power to the former Premier, Wen Jiabao, and was seen as having limited say over the PLA with no military background, Mr. Xi has centralised power by creating a National Security Commission and a central group for economic policy under his direct control.\nWhile Chinese officials have acknowledged there is now some degree of comfort between Beijing and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) governments following engagement over two terms, officials here also have warm recollections of their dealings with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a leader held in high regard here.\nIn sharp contrast to the belated outreach from Washington, Beijing has carefully courted BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, hosting him as Gujarat Chief Minister in 2011.\n&#8220;If we look back at history, in 2003 the NDA Prime Minister, Mr. Vajpayee, paid a very successful visit to China and broke the ice between the two countries in some ways,&#8221; said Lan Jianxue, a South Asia scholar at the China Institute of International Studies. &#8220;China is already acquainted with Mr. Modi.

Chandrashekar who participated in the assessment. The Chinese had come up with &#8220;a very innovative system&#8221; based on well-understood components.\nChina''s constellation of Yaogan military satellites includes those for electronic intelligence (ELINT) gathering that detect radio signals and other electronic emissions from an aircraft carrier and its associated warships. China currently has three clusters of ELINT satellites that provide global surveillance. \nIn each cluster, there are three satellites that maintain a triangular formation in orbit and can locate ships producing radio signals with an accuracy of 25 km to 100 km, according to him. \nThe Yaogan constellation also includes radar satellites as well as satellites with optical sensors that can establish the position of the aircraft carriers with much greater accuracy.\nIn the course of a single day, the current Yaogan constellation can provide about 16 targeting opportunities for ballistic missile launches when the uncertainity in an aircraft carrier''s position will be less than 10 km. \n&#8220;These preliminary results suggest that China has in place a space-based surveillance system that can identify, locate and track an aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean,&#8221; according to a recent report prepared by the analysts.\nAlthough the land-based ballistic missiles can target aircraft carriers using just the Yaogon constellation, the number of targeting opportunities become fewer if cloud cover obscures the view of satellites with optical sensors, observed Prof. Chandrashekar.\nBy incorporating an over-the-horizon radar that can continually track aircraft carriers up to a distance of about 3,000 km, the Chinese gain the flexibility to launch the ballistic missiles whenever they choose, he pointed out.\nHe and his colleagues also found that China could modify its proven DF-21 ballistic missile to carry a manoeuverable warhead. With an onboard radar, the warhead could, as it is descended through the atmosphere, precisely locate the moving aircraft carrier and then adjust its trajectory to strike the ship with conventional munitions.\nTheir analysis of openly accessible images of the DF-21D indicated that this missile variant met the dimensional requirements for such a mission. It could hit ships that were about 2,000 km from the Chinese mainland. \nThe F-18 Super Hornet, the U.S. Navy''s main carrier-borne attack aircraft, has a mission radius of about 750 km. China would therefore want to prevent America''s formidable Carrier Strike Groups from venturing within 1,000 km of its coast, their report observed.\nThe Chinese military is known to have successfully tested the ASBM against a land-based simulation of an aircraft carrier, according to him. \n&#8220;The open literature does not provide any information about whether the system has also been tested with a ship at sea,&#8221; he told this correspondent.', 'ballistic,powerful,ballistic,manoeuvrable,conventional,traditional,unassailable,credible,American,several,Asian,possible,ballistic,innovative,military,electronic,other,electronic,global,triangular,optical,much,single,current,ballistic,preliminary,locate,recent,ballistic,cloud,optical,ballistic,ballistic,manoeuverable,locate,conventional,accessible,dimensional,such,Chinese,main,want,formidable,coast,military,open,', ' accessible credible innovative open powerful traditional unassailable', ' formidable', 7, -1, 6, 8),

On account of the weakening rupee, however, India''s effective defence spending in dollar terms actually fell from last year, down to $ 36.2 billion from $ 37.5 billion.\n\n\n"There is a yawning gap emerging in the conventional capabilities between China and India," warned Brig. (Retd) Arun Sahgal, Director of the Forum for Strategic Initiative in New Delhi.\n\n\n"This asymmetry is increasing by the day, and the fundamental point is that the Chinese, because of a strong economic position and a very definite plan, are focused on military modernisation".\n\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang, who presented the government''s annual report to the NPC''s opening session, vowed to carry out "coordinated planning for military preparedness in all scenarios" and to push the development of "new and high technology weapons and equipment". He said China would also enhance border, coastal and air defences and "place war preparations on a regular footing".\n\n\nAt the same time, his work report said China would "advance neighbourhood diplomacy" and "speed up" infrastructure links with neighbours. Mr. Li specifically highlighted the on-going plans to build a Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) economic corridor, a "maritime silk road" linking Asia and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and a corridor linking China and Pakistan as priorities.\n\n\nChinese military analysts explained the defence hike as a response to China''s challenges in the region, such as on-going territorial differences with Japan over East China Sea islands, and recent disputes in the South China Sea.\n\n\n"In order to protect the country and safeguard regional peace and stability, China has to enhance its national defence," said Chen Zhou, a researcher with the People''s Liberation Army''s Academy of Military Sciences and a member of the NPC, adding that China was facing "increasing strategic pressure" with some countries in Asia "speeding up strategic adjustments and strengthening military alliances", in a reference to the U.S. "pivot".\n\n\n"The comparatively low level of input into national defence, coupled with a high-risk security environment, dictates that we must raise our defence budget on a moderate scale," he told the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\nAsked about fears voiced by some countries in the region, such as Japan, about China''s military spending, Qin Gang, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said the PLA was not made up of "boy scouts with spears".\n\n\n"Some foreigners always expect China to be a boy scout. In that way, how can we safeguard national security and world peace? Even as a scout grows up, his former dress and shoes will not fit anymore and thus he will have to change into bigger ones," he said.\n\n\nThe spending hike will, nevertheless, likely raise concerns, analysts say, as the gulf in military capabilities continues to widen even as territorial disputes remain unresolved.\n\n\nBrig. (Retd) Sahgal said with the increased spending, China''s "coercion index" vis-Ã -vis countries like India had increased. \n\n"In India, unfortunately, the last decade has been a lost decade," he said. "The Chinese are now increasing their budget by the total Indian defence budget. In the past four years, there hasn''t been a single purchase, or modernisation of the three services, while our equipment is getting depleted.

The corridor envisages expanding road links, building a railway line and installing energy pipelines running from the western Xinjiang region to Pakistan through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), which provides the only land link connecting the two countries. \n\nOn Wednesday, following talks between the two leaders, both sides only announced more modest agreements that had been expected. \n\nOf the four deals signed, one was to upgrade the second phase of the Karakoram Highway, which runs from Xinjiang, through PoK, all the way to Islamabad. The second was for the building of an international airport at Gwadar. \n\nIt is understood that both agreements are, however, yet to be fleshed out. Asked by <i>The Hindu</i> about China&#8217;s planned investment into the two projects, Luo Zhaohui, Director General of the Foreign Ministry&#8217;s Asian Affairs Department and its top official on Asia policy, said the two sides were still in discussion. \n\nBoth sides also did not announce any agreement on the proposed investment fund.

Last year, a Chinese firm took over the operational contract for the port from a Singapore company in the hope of reviving the plan.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the only other two agreements signed were for the establishment of research institutes for small-scale hydropower technology and to set up Confucius Institutes in Pakistan.\n\n\nNo agreements on new nuclear projects were announced, although Chinese officials said cooperation in this field would continue.

It has also exposed a web of graft that stretched from mafia groups in Sichuan to wealth State-run oil companies, and appeared to proliferate under the patronage of one of the CPC&#8217;s most powerful leaders, raising difficult questions for China&#8217;s ruling party.\n So far, State media reports have not named Mr. Zhou. But the carefully orchestrated, and officially sanctioned, reports detailing the purges of half a dozen officials linked with the former security czar have heightened speculation about his fate.\n As of last week, four officials who were known widely to have served as his political aides had all been removed from their posts.\n On Friday, Liang Ke, a top official of the Beijing State Security department &#8212; an intelligence office responsible for handling both internal and external threats to the Party &#8212; was removed, official media said in a brief report. Separately, Shen Dingcheng, an official of a prominent oil company, was said to have been detained by investigators, according to two journalists at Party-connected newspapers.\n Only a day earlier, Liu Yingxia, a prominent businesswoman with ties to the oil industry and an estimated net worth of $ 660 million, was removed from her post on a top political advisory body.\n Ms. Liu, ranked by the Hurun wealth report as China&#8217;s 46th richest woman, had business dealings with the State-run China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), an influential oil firm where Mr. Zhou once served as a top official, before he took over the State security apparatus.\n The three purges followed the removal of another top CNPC official and Central Committee member, Jiang Jiemin. In December, another former aide of Mr. Zhou, Li Dongsheng, a Vice Minister of Public Security, was placed under investigation.\n The crackdown has also gone after businessmen in western Sichuan province, where Mr. Zhou served as Party secretary &#8212; his third power base, beyond the oil industry and State security.\n On Thursday, the State-run <i>Xinhua </i>news agency published an unusually detailed report laying bare the collusion between mafia groups in Sichuan, real estate companies, prominent businessmen and Party bosses &#8212; a story of how fortunes were made by businessmen with the help of their Communist Party patrons, a common feature of post-reforms China but a narrative that sits uneasily with the ruling Communist Party.\n Allegations of corruption centred around local tycoon Liu Han, who built an empire spanning energy companies, real estate and construction industries. \nThe <i>Xinhua </i>report detailed how gangs operated with impunity, shooting their rivals dead in Sichuan tea-houses in broad daylight. \nPolice seized three hand grenades, 20 guns, 677 bullets and 2,163 ball-bullets in raids.\n Even the Party&#8217;s official <i>People&#8217;s Daily </i>on Friday published a series of reports detailing corruption of mafia groups and businesses in Sichuan. One report mysteriously alluded to the groups&#8217; &#8220;protective umbrella&#8221; in the Party.\n Another media report linked Mr. Liu with the prominent businessman Zhou Bin. It left unsaid that Mr. Zhou Bin was none other Mr. Zhou Yongkang&#8217;s own son.', 'powerful,senior,past,few,political,top,former,senior,former,powerful,open,public,many,first,political,new,stretched,powerful,former,last,political,top,responsible,internal,external,official,brief,net,top,political,influential,top,top,former,western,third,real,prominent,common,narrative,local,real,broad,other,own,', ' broad influential open powerful prominent real responsible top', '', 8, 0, 8, 8),

China has often exerted pressure on foreign leaders and warned them that bilateral ties, and even trade relations, could suffer if they hosted the Dalai Lama.\n\n\nMr. Obama first hosted the Dalai Lama in February 2010. On that occasion, the White House appeared to attempt to assuage China&#8217;s anger by playing down the meeting, which took place not in the official and symbolic Oval Office but in the Map room, and away from the glare of the cameras.\n\n\nMr. Obama''s second meeting with the Dalai Lama came more than a year later, in July 2011, amid perceptions that the U.S., which was deepening engagement and seeking Chinese cooperation on a range of issues from trade to North Korea, was giving less weight to Tibet-related issues than in the past.\n\n\nFriday&#8217;s meeting also took place in the Map room, with the White House again appearing to tone down the affair. The Dalai Lama was not seen entering or leaving the White House by official photographers.\n\n\nMr. Obama reiterated that the U.S. did not support Tibetan independence, but affirmed his support for Tibet&#8217;s religious, cultural and linguistic identity and for ensuring Tibetans&#8217; human rights. He pointed out that the Dalai Lama himself had sought genuine autonomy for Tibetans, and not independence, in his &#8220;middle way&#8221; approach.\n\n\nChina, however, repeated its accusations that the Dalai Lama was a &#8220;splittist.&#8221; \n\nThe Foreign Ministry in a statement described the exiled spiritual leader as &#8220;a political exile who has long engaged in anti-China secessionist activities in the name of religion.&#8221;\n\n\nA commentary by the official Xinhua news agency criticised the Dalai Lama&#8217;s &#8220;middle way&#8221; approach as &#8220;nothing but smoke and mirrors, camouflage and deceit.&#8221;\n', 'top,American,spiritual,domestic,angry,similar,previous,foreign,bilateral,symbolic,second,later,Chinese,religious,cultural,linguistic,human,spiritual,political,commentary,', ' spiritual top', ' angry', 2, -1, 1, 3),

The Shanxi coal project was, after all, one of only hundreds of similar ventures that sprouted across the country post-2009.\nAn unprecedented expansion in the steel industry on account of easy credit enabled by the stimulus measures, and surging real estate investments that have fuelled a property bubble, have left overcapacity problems in both sectors. Worryingly, these were the two sectors that attracted the most investment over the past three years.\nAccording to official estimates, trusts&#8217; assets rose by 60 per cent during the third quarter of last year, reaching 10 trillion yuan ($1.65 trillion).\nData released last week by the official China Trustee Association underlined how the surging property sector has been driven in large part by financing from trusts. Remarkably, trusts provided more financing for the property sector than bank loans, according to official figures reported by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Between October and December, trust funding of 140 billion yuan ($24.56 billion) found its way to the property sector, marking a 10-fold increase in just one year, up from 11 billion yuan ($1.81 billion). Loans from banks reached 80 billion yuan ($13.19 billion).\nOn Friday [last], another trust linked to a coal investment emerged to be in trouble, as a $50 million investment product offered to clients of the China Construction Bank, the country&#8217;s second biggest bank, failed to repay investors on time. The product was tied to a loan offered to another Shanxi coal company. The trust said it was unsure when clients would be paid.\nTwo of China&#8217;s biggest steel trading companies are also bracing themselves for lawsuits in the coming weeks over debt problems. Xiao Jiashou, known as China&#8217;s steel trading &#8220;king&#8221;, is facing 22 lawsuits from a number of banks, while Zhou Huarui, head of the Shanghai Steel Services Trade group, is facing 18 lawsuits over unpaid loans.\nChina&#8217;s CITIC bank had outstanding loans to steel companies amounting to 40 billion yuan ($6.6 billion) as of last year, with NPLs estimated at 8 per cent, while other major banks are also exposed by failing investments in the sector. The fate of hundreds of smaller steel companies is also tied to the two cases.\n&#8220;Big steel traders guaranteed the loans of smaller steel trading firms, and sometimes traders used property as collateral to several banks at the same time,&#8221; Zhang Lin, an analyst at the Beijing Lange Steel Information Research Centre, told the <i>Global Times</i>. &#8220;If one of them meets problems, it is very likely to have a domino effect,&#8221; he said, leaving an uncertain few months ahead for the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.', 'major,quick,new,global,financial,massive,private,Industrial,traditional,financial,northern,overall,Chinese,new,previous,similar,easy,real,bubble,past,third,last,last,large,last,second,unpaid,outstanding,yuan,last,other,major,collateral,several,same,Global,likely,few,', ' easy large outstanding real traditional', '', 5, 0, 5, 5),

Yuan Dong was given an 18-month jail term, while Hou Xin was found guilty of &#8220;gathering a crowd to disrupt public order&#8221; but spared time in jail.\nMr. Xu was on Sunday found guilty of the same offence, but given a heavier four-year sentence. The charges stem from a series of public protests held last year in a number of cities, which saw activists hold up banners calling on CPC officials to declare their assets.\nMany of the protesters were part of a &#8220;New Citizens Movement&#8221; that Mr. Xu helped establish last year, initially through informal dinner meetings held in Beijing that brought together a small group of people, including lawyers, entrepreneurs and scholars, advocating greater political participation for Chinese citizens.\nSo far, at least 10 people have been put on trial and face charges, while more than a dozen others are thought to be in detention. Mr. Xu was the most well-known member of the movement. A prominent lawyer, he had come to national prominence &#8212; and even received praise from state media &#8212; over his law firm&#8217;s pioneering work, which succeeded in reforming custody laws after a student was beaten to death in detention and also brought awareness to the plight of migrant workers, whose children are denied access to education in cities. His law firm Gongmeng, or the Open Constitution Initiative, was shut down in 2009 by authorities, on alleged tax violations.\nDuring his trial last week, he defended the New Citizens Movement. &#8220;We did nothing to disrupt public order, we were merely exercising our freedom of expression as provided for by the Constitution,&#8221; he told the court. The charge of &#8220;disrupting public order&#8221; was tied to two protests: one held by some migrant workers, who Mr. Xu had represented and had gathered outside the Ministry of Education to call for overhauling restrictions that denied their children access to schools in cities; and the second tied to a protest calling for officials&#8217; assets to be made public.\nMr. Xu told the court, &#8220;Here in absurd post-totalitarian China I stand trial, charged with three crimes: promoting equal education rights for children of migrant workers, calling on officials to publicly disclose their assets, and advocating that all people behave as citizens with pride and conscience.&#8221;\nMr. Xu was not the first activist to be arrested over the movement. In October 2013, Wang Gongquan, a well-known billionaire entrepreneur, was detained over his involvement with the movement.\nLast month, Liu Ping, Wei Zhongping and Li Sihua, three activists who had carried out a public protest over disclosing assets in the southern province of Jiangxi were put on trial. Ms. Liu&#8217;s lawyer, Zhang Xuezhong, said the charge of &#8220;gathering a crowd&#8221; stemmed from her campaigning for election in 2011 as an independent candidate.\nLike Mr. Xu the lawyer, Ms. Liu, a retired factory worker, had first attempted to push for change from within the system. As China allows direct elections only at the local-level, Ms. Liu stood as an independent candidate for a position on the local People&#8217;s Congress, or government body, in the Jiangxi city of Xinyu.\nIn an interview with <i>The Hindu</i> during her campaign, she said she hoped to raise political awareness. &#8220;Our Constitution says we have a universal right to participate in government. I want us to achieve that right,&#8221; she said.\nShe said she found &#8220;overwhelming&#8221; public support, as she mobilised voters through social media. The local government, however, soon began disrupting her campaign, and went as far as threatening her daughter, who was enrolled in college, to dissuade Ms. Liu. Chastened by the government&#8217;s response, Ms. Liu later took to the New Citizens Movement, which offered a more direct &#8212; even if riskier &#8212; path for advocacy.\nEven if the movement&#8217;s members have now been silenced, it has triggered debate about the way forward for reforms. Last week, 78 Beijing academics and lawyers penned an open letter calling on the government to abide by the Chinese Constitution and ensure the right to assembly and protest. This followed the charging of several activists with &#8220;disrupting public order&#8221; &#8212; an offence that brought a heavy four year jail term for Mr. Xu.\nThe letter argued that Article 35 of the Constitution, which guaranteed the right of assembly, association and demonstration, had been violated by a lower level administrative law restricting protests. \n&#8220;By imposing administrative approval on constitutional rights, the law.. contravenes the Constitution,&#8221; said the letter, which was written by Teng Biao, a legal scholar at the China University of Political Science and Law, and signed by 77 other academics.\nThe letter said the restrictions &#8220;deprive in essence citizens of their rights to assemble, march and demonstrate and contravenes the Constitution.&#8221; It called for the National People&#8217;s Congress, or Parliament, to carry out a constitutional review when the annual session opens on March 5.\nOne of the signatories, Beijing-based historian Zhang Lifan, told <i>The Hindu</i> in a recent interview that bringing about systemic changes &#8212; and moving towards Constitutionalism &#8212; was the only effective way to address issues such as corruption.\nThe new leadership under Mr. Xi has repeatedly pledged to crack down on graft.\nBut &#8220;the ruling party finds it hard to cut off its own interests,&#8221; he said.\n &#8220;The anti-corruption campaign is being carried out within the Party, so there is no effective supervision.&#8221;\n&#8220;At the end of the Qing Dynasty [in 1911],&#8221; he added, &#8220;people struggled for constitutional democracy.

It was designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data, along with its stationary lander, <i>Chang&#8217;e 3</i>. \nThe mission has been a popular success for China&#8217;s space program and the rover has attracted more than 150,000 followers on its microblog. It last posted on Saturday saying repairs were underway and hope was not lost. \n&#8220;Sorry to make you all sad. The engineers and I haven&#8217;t given up yet,&#8221; the posting said. \nNews of the rover&#8217;s troubles were splashed across newspapers on Monday and even featured at the Foreign Ministry&#8217;s daily briefing, with spokesman Qin Gang expressing hope that Yutu could &#8220;return to normal.&#8221; \nThe mechanical problems appeared to be related to the solar-powered probe&#8217;s process for shutting down for the lunar night, which lasts more than two weeks. The temperature during that time drops to minus 180 degrees Celsius (minus 292 degrees Fahrenheit). \nThe probe had survived its first lunar night shutdown, during which it is unable to generate energy from its solar panels and relies on a radioactive power source to keep its delicate sensors and other equipment intact. \nThe 140-kilogram (300-pound) rover was traversing a relatively flat part of the moon known as Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, at a speed of 200 meters per hour. The landing vehicle, which has already shut down for the lunar night, is designed to conduct scientific examinations for one year. \nOnline speculation focused on the possibility of lunar dust having blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward, leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures. It won&#8217;t be known if the probe is able to function again until after the two-week break. \nChina&#8217;s space program has made steady progress since the country launched its first manned spacecraft in 2003. It has launched a lunar orbiter, conducted space walks, and put into orbit a prototype space station, to be replaced by a permanent station at the end of the decade. \nAlready a source of enormous national pride, the space program has increasingly sought to connect with the public through social media and educational outreach. China&#8217;s second woman in space, Wang Yaping, conducted China&#8217;s first space classroom to students nationwide from the prototype space station, the Tiangong. \nYutu, or &#8220;Jade Rabbit,&#8221; is named after a mythological Chinese animal said to live on the moon.

Peiris, who welcomed the plan.\nThe initiative was first proposed by the new Chinese President Xi Jinping when he visited Southeast Asia in October last year. That same month, Premier Li Keqiang, who also carried out a high-profile visit to the region, announced the setting up of a 3 billion yuan ($495 million) maritime cooperation fund, part of which would support the plan.\nChinese officials themselves appear to be unclear about what exactly the plan entails, only offering general contours of the initiative such as boosting regional maritime connectivity, and cooperation on disaster mitigation and fisheries development.\nDiplomats from the region say the nuts and bolts of the initiative still remain unclear. They see the plan as being more about addressing regional anxieties about China&#8217;s rise, reflected in concern over China&#8217;s attitude towards maritime disputes in the South China Sea and, in general, about its expanding naval capabilities, evinced by the recent drills in the Lombok Straits.\nZhou Bo, a Chinese strategic scholar at the Academy of Military Science, suggested as much in an article this week, saying the &#8216;maritime silk road&#8217; may be a response to the &#8220;string of pearls&#8221; theory &#8212; a suggestion that China intended to build military bases in littoral countries, from Sri Lanka to Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n&#8220;Nine years have since elapsed. The phrase, or theory, still sticks in the international media and in some think tank reports [although] these &#8220;bases&#8221; are found nowhere in the Indian Ocean,&#8221; he said in the essay, that was published this week on the official China.org.cn website after first appearing on the website China-U.S Focus.\nCountries ranging from Russia to India and Gulf countries have all been sounded out about the idea. Shortly after the visits by Mr. Xi and Mr. Li to Southeast Asia, Chinese officials said during Prime Manmohan Singh&#8217;s Beijing trip that they also wanted India&#8217;s support for the idea.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry official told the official Xinhua news agency shortly after the visit, when both countries also discussed taking forward a Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) economic land corridor, that &#8220;the flow of funds, goods and people through the Maritime Silk Road across the sub-continent will be identical to what happened in history, a precedent from which the two ancient countries draw wealth and strength for current cooperation.&#8221;\nMr. Zhou, the scholar, said China&#8217;s only two purposes in the Indian Ocean were &#8220;economic gains and the security of Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC)&#8221;.\nIndia and the U.S. were key for China&#8217;s objectives, he added, saying that the U.S. was unlikely to cut off China&#8217;s SLOCs with ties currently being managed. India and China were also managing their differences, he said, with &#8220;the queer idea of China encircling India from the sea with the help of Pakistan only existing in the wildest imagination of some Indian strategists.&#8221;\n&#8220;Access, rather than bases, is what the Chinese Navy is really interested in the Indian Ocean. The unchartered waters of the Indian Ocean could be friendlier than the disputed waters in the Pacific,&#8221; he said.\nThat China&#8217;s new economic outreach faces obstacles amid persisting regional concerns about its naval ambitions was made clear recently by Cambodian officials, who have said unresolved disputes over the South China Sea could derail the plan.\nRos Chantrabot, adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, told Chinese media the plan would bring &#8220;better connectivity&#8221; and boost political and security relations.

The Lombok drills also included simulations for warfare to test the response of command systems and soldiers'' &#8220;combat skills&#8221;. The drills aren''t China''s first in the Indian Ocean: the People''s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has carried out 16 drills, but mostly in the western Indian Ocean near the Gulf of Aden. As with the Gulf of Aden exercises, the drills focused on anti-piracy and search and rescue measures. \n\nHowever, last week''s drills were seen by analysts as being significant by breaking new ground in several ways. This was the first drill of this nature in the Lombok Strait, and also marked the first time the PLAN had, in its drills, charted a new route from the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean. In earlier drills, ships sailed up the much-traversed Malacca Straits, a significant waterway for global trade that opens out near the Andaman Sea, and is a crucial link between the Indian Ocean and East Asia. This also marked the first deployment of the <i>Changbaishan</i>, China''s largest landing ship which is equipped with advanced weapons systems, in a drill of this kind.\n\n\nSrikanth Kondapalli, an expert on the Chinese military at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the drill may have been a signal from China about the dispute over the South China Sea, whose waters and islands are contested by a number of countries. &#8220;The drill took place in Lombok, which is beyond the nine-dotted line [that reflects China''s claims]. This is something new,&#8221; he said, and suggested that the PLAN may be demonstrating its capabilities to access the disputed region from another direction &#8220;from behind&#8221;. \n\nA second signal was tied to the Malacca Straits, which are a key route for China''s energy imports. The dependence on the narrow strait led former leader Hu Jintao to warn of China''s &#8220;Malacca dilemma&#8221;, triggering fresh initiatives by Beijing to establish alternate routes for imports, such as through ports in Myanmar and on-going projects in Bangladesh and Pakistan. &#8220;A third message,&#8221; Professor Kondapalli added, &#8220;is that they can come closer to the Andaman &amp; Nicobar joint command through Lombok, and not just through Malacca&#8221;.\n\n\nHe said the drill could be seen as &#8220;a preliminary attempt&#8221; by the PLAN to see how they can fare in operations far away from China''s borders in the Indian Ocean, where they lack bases for logistics and support. China has recently pushed commercial ties with several littoral states, and is also involved in port projects in a number of countries neighbouring India. \n\nLast year, a Chinese think-tank released a first &#8220;blue book&#8221; or policy advisory on the Indian Ocean, stressing that Beijing should be driven by commercial, rather than military, objectives, considering the importance of the Indian Ocean Region to its energy security. At the same time, it called for &#8220;a clear development strategy in the Indian Ocean Region&#8221; which would &#8220;not only [be] a sign of China''s self-confidence [but] also a clear demonstration of China''s strategic interests.&#8221;\n', 'large,amphibious,north,first,last,significant,new,several,first,first,new,significant,global,crucial,first,advanced,military,new,disputed,second,signal,key,former,fresh,alternate,such,third,preliminary,commercial,several,littoral,Chinese,first,commercial,military,same,clear,clear,strategic,', ' advanced fresh large significant', ' disputed', 4, -1, 3, 5),

An ADIZ is a defined area in international airspace within which countries monitor and track aircraft heading towards their territory.\n\n\nThe setting up of the ADIZ heightened tensions with Japan, as it overlapped with Japan''s zone and included the disputed islands. China at the time defended the move, pointing out that Japan had established its own ADIZ in 1969.\n\n\nAfter a Japanese newspaper reported last week that China was considering setting up a second such zone over the South China Sea &#8211; a move that would be certain to worry the half a dozen or so countries that have competing claims over the sea''s waters and islands &#8211; the Chinese Foreign Ministry was quick to deny the report, and also, at the same time, accuse Tokyo of attempting to fan tensions.\n\n\n"In a general view, the Chinese side has yet to feel any air security threat from the ASEAN countries and is optimistic about its relations with the neighbouring countries and the general situation in the South China Sea region", Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said in a statement.\n\n\nHe blamed "right-wing forces of Japan" for "repeatedly clamor[ing]" about the alleged plan of China to set up ADIZ over the South China Sea". "We sternly warned these forces not to mislead public opinions with rumors and play up tensions for their own selfish benefit," he said.\n\n\nChina-Japan relations have soured over the past year over the disputed islands, and issues relating to wartime history and the Japanese occupation of China during the Second World War. China was especially angered by a visit by the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the\n\n\ncontroversial Yasukuni war shrine - a memorial for Japanese who died during the war that also enshrines 14 Class-A war criminals &#8211; which was the first by a Japanese leader in seven years.\n\n\nThe rising tensions with Japan have coincided with an apparent diplomatic outreach by China to other Asian countries, ostensibly aimed at attempting to isolate Tokyo.

The movement attracted a following of a few thousand people &#8211; a small number in the context of China&#8217;s 1.3 billion population, yet significant enough to concern the authorities, who have, in recent months, detained more than a dozen activists associated with the movement.\n\n\nOne likely reason for the movement&#8217;s appeal was its specific demand on making public the assets of officials, an issue that has wide resonance in China, where even the ruling Communist Party has admitted that rampant graft had stirred public anger.\n\n\nThe meetings attracted a range of followers, from students to white-collar professionals and lawyers. When the movement took to the streets with members displaying banners to raise awareness, it was always likely to incur the wrath of the authorities, who began detaining and arresting protesters.\n\n\nIn October 2013, billionaire entrepreneur Wang Gongquan was detained over his involvement with the movement. Then in December, three activists, who had unfurled banners in southern Jiangxi province, were put on trial. Last week, six other activists stood trial, including five people in Beijing and one in southern Guangzhou.\n\n\nMr. Xu was a well-known lawyer before his involvement with the movement. His legal firm, Gongmeng or the Open Constitution Initiative, had established a national reputation for pioneering work after it successfully took on a number of sensitive cases, even winning praise from State media.\n\n\nGongmeng brought about significant legal reforms when it took up the case of a 27-year-old graduate student, who was beaten to death in police custody in Guangzhou, where he had been detained for not carrying identification papers. The government subsequently overhauled custody laws.\n\n\nMr. Xu later represented victims of milk poisoning. He had also campaigned for the rights of migrant workers, specifically pushing for reforms of discriminatory household registration or hukou laws that deny their children access to education in city schools.\n\n\nGongmeng was subsequently forced to shut down in 2009, when it was accused of tax fraud. Its members, however, said then that the government had wanted to clamp down on what it saw as legal activism.\n\n\nExplaining the motivations of the anti-corruption movement in his closing speech, Mr. Xu told the court that corruption had &#8220;become more and more rampant over the course of the last sixty some years&#8221;.\n\n\n&#8220;Without democratic elections, press freedom and judicial independence, a clean government is not possible under a regime of absolute power," he said.\n\n\n&#8220;In a servile society prone widely to submission, there will always need to be someone to be the first to stand up, to face the risks and pay the price for social progress.

The impact of this decision will roil global industries from aluminium to steel manufacturing.\nIndonesia is the world&#8217;s largest exporter of nickel ore, refined tin and thermal coal, and home to the fifth-largest copper mine and the top gold mine. Mineral shipments totalled $10.4 billion in 2012 according to the World Bank. Not all minerals will be equally affected by the ban however, and certain, primarily American, mining corporations, have been granted exemptions as well.\nThe reasoning behind the ban lies in an attempt to boost the domestic processing industries, by mandating that ores are processed locally before being exported. Despite having seen an average of 6 percent growth in recent years, Indonesia&#8217;s remains a largely commodities-driven economy and policy-makers are keen to try and kick start more high-value added, local manufacturing.\nHowever, the move has been opposed by both domestic and foreign miners resulting in lay-offs and strikes in the mining sector. Officials are also worried that a short-term cut in foreign revenue could widen the current account deficit, which could further put pressure on the already battered, rupiah, the country&#8217;s currency.\nCompanies that build local smelters and process the ore domestically will still be allowed to export their products. However, the hundreds of small domestic miners that cannot afford to build a smelter, which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, will be adversely impacted.\nPresident Yudhoyono has now signed a regulation that waters down the export ban somewhat, largely to accommodate the demands of American mining giant Freeport. \nFreeport, which holds a 73 percent market share in Indonesia&#8217;s copper production, warned last month that unless the ban was revised, it would reduce output at one of its mines by 60 percent and also be forced to lay off half of its 15,000 Indonesian employees.\nUnder the regulation, Freeport and Newmont Mining, would still be allowed to export copper, manganese, lead, zinc and iron ore concentrate until 2017, by when they must build smelters to process the ore locally. But nickel ore and bauxite exports worth more than $2 billion annually will be banned. \n Coal and tin shipments will not be affected. This is good news for India, since Indonesia supplied 75 percent of Indian imports of thermal coal in 2013. \nWorst hit by the ban will probably be China. China imports close to a quarter of its bauxite &#8211; a raw ingredient for the production of aluminium &#8212; from Indonesia, and may force China to curtail some of its refining and smelting capacity.

It looks like the Chinese ghost will not go away. The Union Home Ministry has advised the Petroleum Ministry against considering Chinese firms for the award of exploration rights in oil and gas blocks due to &#8220;security reasons&#8221;. The on-land blocks in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab proposed for auction are located close to the border with Pakistan where apparently China is engaged in different projects. The blocks in the northeast and offshore ones in the Mahanadi basin, says the Home Ministry, are &#8220;close to sensitive defence installations and strategic assets&#8221;. In its view, these blocks should therefore be given only to Indian public sector companies for exploration. The Home Ministry also wants its advice to be kept in mind while finalising sub-contracts for services such as equipment procurement, consultancy and maintenance. Truth to tell, it is not as if too many foreign companies are lining up to invest in the country&#8217;s oil and gas exploration sector, not to talk of Chinese ones. The auctioning of oil exploration blocks under the New Exploration Licensing Policy has attracted but tepid attention from foreign bidders in the last couple of rounds, and the story is likely to be the same in the upcoming one as well.\n\n\nYet, the bogey of threat from Chinese companies needs to be busted. For all its exertions in recent years, the government has not provided concrete evidence of any wrongdoing by Chinese companies in the telecom and IT sectors. Its warnings have been based on mere suspicion &#8212; which is not enough grounds to keep out a foreign investor, especially in these difficult times for the economy. On the other hand, it was Facebook, Google and Twitter, companies that are headquartered in what is supposed to be a friendly country, which were in the eye of a storm over sharing data from their servers, including that of Indians, with the U.S. National Security Agency. This proves companies from friendly countries are as capable of aiding espionage as those from not-so-friendly ones. And the answer is not to ban or show the door to all multinationals but to put in place protective systems to safeguard the country&#8217;s interests and assets. In the case of the oil blocks there is indeed a problem as these are located in strategic or sensitive parts of the country. Instead of trying to keep out companies from one country or the other, the government would do well to create a reporting and monitoring system that will enable security agencies to keep an eye on the activities of these companies, especially when it comes to blocks located close to defence installations. That is the way to handle security threats.\n', 'Chinese,Chinese,due,close,different,sensitive,strategic,such,many,foreign,Chinese,tepid,foreign,last,likely,same,recent,concrete,mere,foreign,difficult,other,friendly,friendly,capable,protective,strategic,sensitive,other,close,', ' capable concrete friendly protective sensitive', ' close difficult mere tepid', 5, -4, 1, 9),

Some of the protesters were later taken away by the police.\nMr. Xu and his lawyer, Zhang Qingfang, have protested the conduct of the trial. Both chose not to speak during Wednesday&#8217;s closed-door proceedings. Mr. Zhang later told reporters he believed there was no possibility of a fair trial.\nMr. Xu is the most prominent face of an anti-corruption rights movement that has spread its presence among progressive Chinese in the past year. Established in 2012, the &#8220;New Citizens Movement&#8221; began through informal dinner meetings aimed at spreading rights awareness. \nThe campaign later took to the streets, with members unfurling banners at street corners in several cities across China, calling on officials to declare their assets. As photographs began to be shared widely through social media websites and the movement gained traction, the Party stepped in and began detaining its members.\nThe New Citizens Movement had attracted followers from a cross-section of society, from executives to lawyers and students. In October, a billionaire entrepreneur, Wang Gongquan, was detained over his involvement with the movement.\nMr. Xu, who had established a reputation as a muckraking lawyer who took on sensitive cases, was in many ways the face of the movement.\nBefore he started the movement in 2012, he ran a legal firm in Beijing called Gongmeng, or the Open Constitution Initiative. His team of lawyers took on sensitive cases, representing the victims of milk poisoning and the families of migrant workers who were prevented from enrolling their children in city schools.\nThe organisation won acclaim after it took up the case of a 27-year-old graduate student, Sun Zhigang, who was beaten to death in a Guangzhou police station in 2003 after he was found without identification papers. Outcry over the case brought far-reaching reforms of custody laws. Gongmeng was closed down in 2009 when it was raided by the government for alleged tax violations.\nMr. Xu is not the first member of the New Citizens Movement to face trial. Since last March, when the new leader Xi Jinping took over as President, more than 50 activists have been detained, according to Human Rights Watch, which has monitored their cases. Many of them were linked with the movement, and had been campaigning for assets disclosure and for greater political rights.\nMr. Xi, the President, has pledged to tackle rampant corruption by going after both &#8220;tigers&#8221; and &#8220;flies&#8221; in the CPC, referring to high-level officials and lower cadres. The Party has, however, cracked down on anti-corruption activists, wary of the widely prevalent public anger on the issue.\nSix other activists will stand trial later this week in Beijing, while one activist is set to face trial in Guangzhou. \nThe first trials of those detained began in December, when three activists in southern Jiangxi were put on trial. Â One of them was Liu Ping, a retired factory worker who unsuccessfully sought to enter politics by contesting local-level elections. China only allows elections at the lowest administrative level.\nFollowing her failed campaign, Ms. Liu and her family faced threats and harassment from the police. In an interview before her detention, she told The Hindu she was not campaigning for a political revolution\nor drastic changes, but only for the government to enforce what the Constitution of China already guarantees its citizens in terms of their political rights.\n&#8220;Our Constitution says we have a universal right to participate in government,&#8221; she said then. &#8220;I want us to achieve that right&#8221;.', 'Chinese,high,Chinese,public,heavy,few,later,later,fair,prominent,progressive,Chinese,past,informal,later,several,social,sensitive,many,legal,sensitive,migrant,alleged,first,last,new,political,rampant,wary,prevalent,public,other,later,trial,first,administrative,political,drastic,political,', ' fair progressive prominent sensitive', ' drastic rampant trial wary', 4, -4, 0, 8),

The previous decade saw record double-digit growth, with the country defying the global slowdown to grow 10.4 per cent in 2010 as it unveiled a massive $ 586 billion stimulus.\n\n\nGrowth slowed in the fourth quarter to 7.7 per cent, down from 7.8 per cent in the previous quarter. This brought annual growth to 7.7 per cent, down from last year''s 7.8 per cent.\n\n\nMa Jiantang, head of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), attributed the slower growth to a &#8220;complex and severe situation&#8221; at home and abroad, as he announced last year''s data.\n\n\n&#8220;If you look at the first half of the year, the domestic and international situation was complex and severe, and economic recovery in developed countries was quite slow. The downward economic pressure in China was mounting&#8221;.\n\n\nThe Chinese leadership had announced a 7.5 per cent growth target for the year, a lower target aimed at shifting the focus from recording high growth to achieving more balanced and sustainable growth.\n\n\nMonday''s data showed the government had made modest progress in its goal of transforming the State-led investment model and boosting domestic consumption, services and innovation industries.\n\n\nFixed asset investment recorded 19.6 per cent growth, reaching 43.6 trillion Yuan ($7.2 trillion), marking a decline from last year''s 20.6 per cent growth figure. However, retail sales grew only 13.1 per cent, reaching 23.4 trillion Yuan ($3.86 trillion), underlining the challenge posed by slowing domestic demand.\n\n\nMr. Ma of the NBS still did express optimism that the restructuring process had made headway.\n\n\n&#8220;The share of the tertiary industry in China''s GDP was 46.1 per cent, and this is the first time that it has surpassed the secondary industry in terms of share of GDP,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nRegional imbalances between the prosperous coastal east, which has driven China''s export-led growth over the past three decades, and the hinterland, had also narrowed. The share of GDP of central and western regions was 44.4 per cent, up 0.2 per cent from last year. &#8220;This shows an improved industrial and regional structure,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nThe urban-rural income gap had narrowed to 3.03, from a highest level of 3.33 in 2009.

It was in this cold north-eastern city, earlier known as Mukden, where Japanese troops, Chinese scholars say, staged an explosion of a Japanese railway line in 1931 as a pretext to launch a full-blown invasion. The Japanese occupation of China, which lasted until the end of the Second World War in 1945, remains an emotive issue in China today.\n\n\nChinese state media frequently highlight atrocities committed by invading troops, such as the &#8220;Rape of Nanking&#8221; that left, according to Chinese estimates, more than 300,000 people killed. The question of history has begun to occupy increasingly prominent attention in bilateral relations seventy years on.\n\n\nChina has accused Mr. Abe, a Conservative politician who took office in December 2012, of attempting to rewrite history and downplay atrocities. Mr. Abe recently angered both China and South Korea &#8211; which also faced Japanese occupation &#8211; by becoming the first Japanese leader in seven years to visit the Yasukuni Shrine, which honours Japan&#8217;s civilian war-dead but also enshrines 14 Class-A war criminals, including officials behind the Nanking massacre.\n\n\nAlthough Mr. Abe expressed &#8220;severe remorse for the past&#8221; and pledged &#8220;never to wage a war again,&#8221; the visit brought condemnation from Beijing and Seoul. This contested history is on display in the sprawling campus of the museum, which declares as its mission &#8220;Taking history as lesson, anticipating peace and guarding against the rebirth of Japanese Imperial militarism.&#8221;\n\n\nSomewhat controversially, its exhibits include a display of Mr. Abe&#8217;s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who served for three years as a senior official in the Manchukuo puppet government installed in Shenyang following the invasion. Kishi was initially charged with war crimes but was subsequently cleared of the charges by a Tokyo tribunal. He later rejoined politics and went on to become Prime Minister in 1957.\n\n\nThe exhibit, however, says, &#8220;He is a first degree war criminal. He was once head of the industrial ministry of the Manchukuo government. He was later Japanese Prime Minister in 1957 and 1958.&#8221; A guide pointedly explained to visitors that the official was &#8220;the grandfather of the Japanese Prime Minister Abe.&#8221;\n\n\nThe display reflects perceptions among many Chinese officials that Mr. Abe is a &#8220;revisionist&#8221; bent upon denying wartime history, and also rewriting Japan&#8217;s pacifist Constitution and reviving militarism &#8211; claims that Japan rejects. Tokyo has itself expressed anxiety over what it sees as a threat from China&#8217;s own massive military modernisation and assertiveness in disputes with several neighbours.\n\n\n&#8220;I think we can see the influence of his grandfather in the Prime Minister&#8217;s own outlook,&#8221; said Wang Jianxue, a historian and scholar affiliated with the museum. &#8220;His grandfather spent three years here as a vice minister. Only if we learn this history,&#8221; he added, &#8220;can we appreciate today&#8217;s peace.&#8221;\n\n\nMr. Abe has written that he felt &#8220;strong repulsion&#8221; at suggestions that his grandfather was a war criminal suspect. &#8220;Because of that experience, I may have become emotionally attached to &#8216;conservatism,&#8217; on the contrary,&#8221; he wrote in his book &#8220;Toward a Beautiful Country&#8221;, according to a report in the <i>Japan Times</i>.\n\n\nThe Chinese government is showcasing this war time history even as it ratchets up international pressure on Japan. The Shenyang museum was refurbished in 1997 and cost 100 million Yuan to build ($ 16 million), according to curator Jing Xiaoguang. He said it receives 8 million visitors a year, with school students accounting for around 60 per cent.\n\n\nExhibits display mass graves and include gruesome photographs, showing the severed heads of Chinese lining Shenyang&#8217;s streets and torture in camps.\n\n\n&#8220;From that day on the Japanese invaders went on to commit numerous massacres of unparalleled savagery and committed innumerable criminal acts,&#8221; says one plaque. &#8220;The Chinese people suffered more than 5,000 days and nights of hatred and terror.&#8221;\n', 'open,first,Japanese,first,Japanese,Japanese,East,wartime,Japanese,Chinese,Japanese,emotive,highlight,such,Chinese,prominent,bilateral,Conservative,Japanese,first,Japanese,civilian,Japanese,Imperial,senior,later,degree,industrial,later,Japanese,Japanese,many,Chinese,own,massive,military,several,own,historian,scholar,international,severed,Chinese,Japanese,numerous,innumerable,criminal,', ' highlight imperial open prominent', ' criminal', 4, -1, 3, 5),

At one particularly brutal encounter, the school&#8217;s principal, Bian Zhongyun, was beaten to death by her own students, marking the first death of a teacher during a decade that would see thousands of others face the same tragic fate.\n\n\nSome former students gathered in the middle school on Sunday and paid a tribute to Bian, bowing before a bust that was belatedly set up to remember her death.\n\n\n&#8220;Please allow me to express my everlasting grief and apologies to Principal Bian,&#8221; Ms. Song said in a speech, reported the <i>Beijing News</i> on Monday. &#8220;I failed to protect the school leaders, and this has been a source of lifelong pain,&#8221; she said.\n\n\nMs. Song (64) is not the first former Red Guard to apologise. In recent years, several former students who were involved in the Cultural Revolution&#8217;s chaos have tendered public apologies to their teachers for the abuse and humiliation they suffered. Last year, Chen Xiaolu, another former Red Guard head who was the son of a Party leader, apologised\n\n\nMs. Song&#8217;s apology has triggered particular attention because she was an especially prominent Red Guard as the daughter of a CPC official.\n\n\nDays after Bian&#8217;s death, Ms. Song was publicly honoured at a rally by Mao, during which she famously tied a red armband &#8211; the symbol of the Red Guards &#8211; around his left arm.

And the public? They only found out two months later!&#8221;\n\n\nExactly four decades on, when the CPC was dealing with another destabilising political scandal at its highest levels, it found very quickly it had no veil of secrecy to hide under.\n\n\nOn February 6, 2012, Wang Lijun, the police chief in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing, fled to a United States Consulate in nearby Chengdu seeking protection after a remarkable falling out with his boss, the former Politburo member and Party &#8220;princeling&#8221; Bo Xilai.\n\n\nBefore Party Central in Beijing could even come up with a response to the embarrassment of witnessing an internal political scandal unfold in a Consulate belonging to its greatest rival, photographs of police cars being deployed in an unprecedented siege around the U.S. building were being shared by tens of thousands of Chinese microbloggers within hours.\n\n\nThe weeks that followed what came to be known as &#8220;the Wang Lijun incident&#8221; saw for the first time a political scandal being played out in the public domain, and it appeared, on some instances, beyond the ruling party&#8217;s control.\n\n\nRumours that proliferated on microblogs sharing lurid details about the dealings of Bo Xilai and his family were first met with a wall of silence from State media. One month after his deputy fled to Chengdu, Mr. Bo was sacked, and almost every improbable rumour appeared confirmed.\n\n\nQiao Mu, a Beijing-based journalism professor and an outspoken campaigner for political reformers, sees the dramatic change in China&#8217;s information landscape as a game-changer for the CPC and its politics.\n\n\n&#8220;Each day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so many Chinese are talking about national issues, international issues. What we are seeing is increasing consciousness about how to be a citizen, about rights. The right to express oneself. The right to know. To be well-informed. The right to not only watch CCTV every day!&#8221;, he said, referring to the staid State-broadcaster China Central Television.\n\n\nThe widely popular Twitter equivalent Sina Weibo, which has more than 500 million Chinese users, has emerged as a source of vibrant exchange, despite censorship restrictions. &#8220;The Chinese government still controls newspapers and television. But it is difficult for them to control the Internet, where there are new technologies coming up every day,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nThe Party has, however, proved capable at managing cyberspace so far, employing a vast and complicated apparatus often referred to as the &#8220;Great Firewall of China.&#8221; The Bo Xilai case showed the CPC had also become adept in what it refers to as &#8220;guiding public opinion&#8221; through social media, whether through selective leaks of information or by promoting leading public &#8220;opinion makers.&#8221;\n\n\nBut in the longer term, Mr. Qiao sees as more significant the emergence of what he calls an &#8220;Internet civil society&#8221; in China. &#8220;Marx said once workers were united globally. Now, netizens are united globally,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nIn 2011, the Beijing academic was among a group of scholars, journalists and activists who decided to contest local-level elections as &#8220;independent candidates&#8221; &#8212; the CPC only allows direct elections at the lowest administrative levels. Mr. Qiao&#8217;s &#8212; and the others&#8217; &#8212; biggest ally in challenging establishment candidates was cyberspace.\n\n\n&#8220;The Chinese government maybe changes slowly, but there are a lot of people who are beginning to realise our rights at the grassroots level. We want our voice to be heard. We do not want to be represented by other people. Maybe 10 years ago, without Weibo, it is difficult to mobilise your voters, to share your ideas.&#8221;\n\n\nFor the first time in his university&#8217;s history, Mr. Qiao actually campaigned as any candidate would, enlisting student volunteers, going door-to-door across student dormitories and putting up posters. The authorities soon stepped in, unnerved perhaps about where the campaign would lead. He was stopped from campaigning. Ultimately, he lost the election.\n\n\n&#8220;This was a good example to show how much has changed,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nManaging expectations from an increasingly aware citizenry could emerge as the Party&#8217;s biggest challenge going forward. The CPC&#8217;s new leader, Xi Jinping, began his term as President in March last year with a high profile anti-corruption campaign, attempting to assuage increasing public anger at rampant graft.\n\n\nHowever effective Mr. Xi&#8217;s administration may be in addressing public demands over its decade in office, rising expectations mean the process will only become tougher for the CPC leadership in years to come. &#8220;Maybe our campaign [to stand as independent candidates] stopped last year, but what about five, ten years later?&#8221; Mr. Qiao said. \n\n&#8220;We have more and more social media users, more and more people from the younger generation, and a greater consciousness of rights. Many problems in China, social or economic, have a root in the political system. For example, corruption. The party has a strict disciplinary policy, but you still see so many cases each year, or even every day. Everything finally leads to a problem of politics.&#8221; \n\nThat, at least, hasn&#8217;t changed in the days from Mao to Xi. \n\n<i>(Concluded)</i>\n', 'remarkable,political,past,famed,told,later,political,nearby,remarkable,former,internal,political,unprecedented,Chinese,first,political,improbable,political,dramatic,many,Chinese,national,international,popular,Chinese,difficult,new,capable,vast,complicated,adept,public,social,selective,public,significant,academic,direct,administrative,other,difficult,first,good,aware,new,last,high,public,rampant,effective,mean,independent,last,social,social,economic,political,strict,disciplinary,many,', ' adept capable effective famed good independent popular remarkable selective significant vast', ' complicated difficult improbable mean rampant strict unprecedented', 11, -7, 4, 18),

At a symposium held to mark the occasion, President Xi Jinping hailed Mao as &#8220;a great Proletarian revolutionary&#8221;, and, close to four decades after Mao&#8217;s death, pledged &#8220;to hold high the banner&#8221; of Mao forever.\n\n\nA stone&#8217;s throw away from where Mr. Xi was speaking, a far less glamorous event was being held &#8212; the launch of the latest statistical &#8220;blue book&#8221; of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a respected think tank.\n\n\nThe book&#8217;s findings could not have been more incongruous, announced on a day when the CPC pledged to protect the legacy of Mao&#8217;s Proletarian revolution: it found that the highest average income levels in China today had soared to &#8220;20 times more than the lowest average&#8221; nationwide, with the increasing wealth gap topping a survey of &#8220;issues that concerned Chinese people most&#8221; in 2013.\n\n\n<b>Disparities in income</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the average annual household income at all levels rose 10 per cent in 2012, according to the blue book, the &#8220;annual income for high income families reached 43,797.5 Yuan [$7,234 approximately] last year, while low income ones only earned 1,587.7 Yuan [$262], more than 20 times less&#8221;, the <i>Global Times </i>reported.\n\n\nThe findings would not have come as a surprise to Wen Tiejun. Professor Wen, who is Dean of the Institute of Advanced Studies for Sustainability at the prestigious Renmin University and also heads its Institute of Rural Finance, has emerged in recent years as among the most influential critics of certain aspects of China&#8217;s market reforms, which have over the past three decades propelled the country&#8217;s growth story.\n\n\nThe reforms that started with overhauling the rural economy in the 1980s laid the foundation for China&#8217;s economic revival, which accelerated further in the 1990s as China&#8217;s market opened to the world. \n\nHowever, the growth model that lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty is coming under fire for leaving behind record inequality, rampant corruption and an unprecedented environmental crisis threatening both the countryside and teeming megacities .\n\n\nProfessor Wen argues that China needs to urgently overhaul its unbalanced growth model, as a new leadership, under Mr. Xi, grapples with launching a second round of reforms.\n\n\nHe is part of a group of scholars who are advocating shifting the focus from China&#8217;s cities to the countryside. &#8220;Originally, the coastal areas developed [faster] a lot of industries set up for export to the West. Now, their market [for exports] has declined, so we have no choice but to invest inland.&#8221;\n\n\nHe hopes the next decade will bring &#8220;a new kind of rural-urban integration&#8221; that will help bridge the widening divide between the cities and countryside. \n\nThis will gradually reverse the migration out of the countryside that has provided the cheap labour driving China&#8217;s factories, and also inject vitality into the rural economy.\n\n\n<b>Empowering townships</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHe argues that investing in infrastructure at the township level will not only create jobs for farmers closer to their homes, but also alleviate the pressures faced by China&#8217;s crowded cities. &#8220;If we give capital only to big cities, you may need to have big slums, like Mumbai or Rio or Mexico city. This is not good for development&#8221;.\n\n\nChina&#8217;s leaders appear to be listening. Between 2006 and 2011, Professor Wen calculates that a total of 4.3 trillion Yuan was invested in rural infrastructure. In 2012, the number rose to 1.8 trillion Yuan.\n\n\nHe says the state sector has to play a key role in this rebalancing, as only it has the capacity to direct investment towards the countryside.\n\n\nThe role of the state has become an increasingly divisive issue for Chinese economists and the media. \n\nThose on the Right argue for stronger market reforms, liberalisation and dismantling State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) as the cure to China&#8217;s problems. This has become a &#8220;mainstream&#8221; view, Professor Wen says.\n\n\n&#8220;We need to go beyond ideology, beyond concepts [such as left or right],&#8221; he adds. &#8220;I am not trying to fight the mainstream, but only trying to give another voice, so people can decide what is in their interest. \n\nWhen we build infrastructure and improve conditions in rural areas, maybe people will choose to stay.&#8221;\n\n\nProfessor Wen on some days, teaches his students on a sprawling vegetable farm he runs in a Beijing suburb.\n\n\nIn between lessons, his students plant vegetables, tend to the chickens and run a small donkey farm.\n\n\n&#8220;Now more and more urban Chinese too don&#8217;t want to live in the cities because of pollution, and are moving to the countryside,&#8221; he says, adding that many have even approached him, asking if there was space for them on his farm.\n\n\n(<i>To be concluded</i>)\n', 'Last,top,120th,great,close,high,glamorous,statistical,incongruous,Proletarian,average,Chinese,annual,blue,high,last,low,Global,prestigious,recent,influential,certain,past,rural,economic,Chinese,rampant,unprecedented,environmental,overhaul,new,second,coastal,next,new,rural,big,big,good,total,rural,key,divisive,Chinese,such,rural,sprawling,vegetable,small,urban,Chinese,many,', ' glamorous good great influential prestigious top', ' close divisive incongruous low rampant unprecedented', 6, -6, 0, 12),

The focus will be on countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and particularly in South and Southeast Asia, where the satellites offered the highest accuracy.\n China has already agreed deals with Pakistan and Thailand on use of the Beidou network, officials said.\n In recent months, China has also had consultations with Sri Lanka, for which it has already launched a satellite, and Bangladesh, over cooperation on satellite use.\n China&#8217;s deepening cooperation with these countries prompted the Indian government, earlier this year, to belatedly prod the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in being more active in providing technological assistance to countries in the neighbourhood in launching satellites.\n For China, however, granting use of its 16-satellite Beidou network &#8211; which will be expand to 35 satellites by 2020 to provide global coverage &#8211; offers an added advantage.\n&#8220;Most countries in the Asia Pacific region can use the complete Beidou system,&#8221; said Ran Chengqi, Director of China Satellite Navigation Office. &#8220;We have open attitude towards international cooperation, and we encourage Beidou to provide better services to the countries in the Asia-Pacific region.&#8221;\nIn May, China signed its first inter-government agreement on the use of Beidou with Pakistan, Mr. Ran said, during the visit of Premier Li Keqiang to Islamabad.\n Early next year, Thailand will become the first country to build a satellite station based on Beidou, with both countries signing a $ 319 million deal, according to State media.\n Mr. Ran told <i>The Hindu </i>that while China was open to any country using the system, so far there was &#8220;no specific cooperation&#8221; between the Indian and Chinese governments. &#8220;With India, we now have cooperation only under the multilateral frameworks, such as the United Nations,&#8221;he said.\n Mr. Ran said the system had improved its position accuracy to five to seven metres in many parts of China and in the ASEAN region, and to 10 metres in other parts of Asia.\nThe system, which was first launched in 2011 for use only by the government and military, has over the past year begun to be widely deployed for civilian uses domestically, he said, with 80 per cent of passenger buses and trucks in China using the system.

The four years of devastation were the darkest period of the CPC&#8217;s rule, with the scale of the disaster arguably even surpassing that of the decade-long Cultural Revolution (1966-76) on account of the sheer magnitude of the tragedy.\nChina&#8217;s farmers, exhorted by Mao Zedong&#8217;s delusions of propelling China to rival the Soviet Union by becoming an industrial superpower overnight, were all told to abandon their farming tools to manufacture iron in backyard furnaces. While fields lay idle, officials fabricated figures to please their Chairman by showing bountiful harvests.\nFamine spread across the land, as millions began to die of starvation even as the <i>People&#8217;s Daily</i> in Beijing reported of China&#8217;s remarkable economic achievements &#8212; fabrications lapped up at the time by Maoists in China and elsewhere. The reality was unimaginably different.\nStarving farmers who tried to leave villages to forage for food to feed their families were shot and killed. Officials who questioned the logic of the campaign were purged. More than 30 million died.\nGiven the scale of the disaster, it is remarkable that in China today, few are even aware about the story of a famine that killed more than 30 million people barely five decades ago. Textbooks speak vaguely of &#8220;three years of natural disasters&#8221;, while Mao&#8217;s responsibility for the loss of tens of millions of lives remains hidden by the Party, which continues to deify him.\nFighting this amnesia has, over the past 25 years, become a mission for Yang Jisheng (73). The veteran Chinese journalist and writer has, over the past three decades, attempted what appeared to be the impossible task of chronicling an account of the famine that is true to history.\nAs a journalist with the Party&#8217;s official Xinhua news agency, Mr. Yang secured access to classified archives &#8212; on the pretext of researching China&#8217;s grain policy &#8212; that exposed alarming facts about the famine.\nThe product of his painstaking research, which was, at unexpected instances, aided by Party cadres who shared a similar sense of indignation about the falsified official account of the period, is a 1000-page treatise titled <i>Tombstone</i>, named in tribute to Mr. Yang&#8217;s father, who died of starvation, in front of his own eyes, when he was only 19.\n&#8220;The authorities have always been trying to avoid this part of history,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My estimation is that 36 million people died. And this is a little conservative, because some things cannot be determined.&#8221;\nEven the second volume of the Party&#8217;s official history, he said, notes that the population decreased &#8220;by 10 million&#8221; from 1958 to 1960 at a time when it should have increased by 10 million. But the Party officially maintains in its accounts that over the three-year period around 16 million people died because of &#8220;natural disasters&#8221;.\nWhat has been consistent in the CPC&#8217;s different accounts of the famine over the years has been a denial of what was a systemic problem. Officials have variously blamed natural conditions or Soviet demands for the payback of loans. After three decades of reforms, China has turned its back on Maoism. Yet, Mr. Yang said, it would be dangerous for the party to turn its back on this chapter of history.\n&#8220;We are not building people&#8217;s communes today. We are not pursuing the Great Leap Forward today. The common people then were not even allowed to look for food, even when they were starving, because the Party said that was being Capitalist! At that time it was a totalitarian system, that is why Mao&#8217;s wrong policy could be carried on for four years. If this was America, Britain or India, the wrong policy would be opposed by people.&#8221;\nMr. Yang is still haunted by the images and stories of mothers and fathers, and sons and daughters, who perished in those years. \nIn his study is a photograph of a desperate woman in her 40s who was seen cutting, with a knife, the bodies of her infant children, who died from starvation, to feed those who were barely surviving.\nA year ago, Mr. Yang met a man, a 60-year-old migrant worker, on the street outside his Beijing home. \nAs they spoke, Mr. Yang learned that the man had lost two relatives during the famine. Yet his 19-year-old grandson, who learned nothing of those years in school, refuses to believe why they died. \n&#8220;His grandson told him, if they were hungry they would grow crops! We should face this part of history directly, so we can learn from it and avoid such mistakes in the future. Learning about this changed everything I thought I knew about political systems and solving problems, about the overcentralisation of power. If we do not tell this part of history, younger generations may never know.

Hu Jintao speaks like he is a man speaking at someone else&#8217;s home. But Xi is like a man speaking in his own home.&#8221;\nProfessor Zhang attributes Mr. Xi&#8217;s rapid ascent to power to his unique political background. Unlike Mr. Hu, Mr. Xi comes from an elite political lineage. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was an influential Party elder, who started out as a Red revolutionary who fought alongside Mao Zedong, and later rose to become a top leader and associate of Deng&#8217;s in the 1980s. He was purged by Mao in the 1960s, imprisoned and suffered abuse, before being rehabilitated to become a top Party leader.\nThe children of many of the elder Xi&#8217;s contemporaries, who grew up together during the turbulent days of Maoism, saw their families experience similar fates. Today, the second Red generation &#8212; or <i>hongerdai</i> as they are known in China &#8212; occupy the highest positions of power in Chinese politics and industry, colloquially referred to as the &#8220;party of Princelings&#8221; or <i>taizidang</i> &#8212; a clutch of families that command special political capital within the CPC.\nThey include the children of former Party elders who rose to the top along with Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s, such as Bo Xilai, another prominent &#8220;princeling&#8221; who climbed to the top of the party before his fall from grace last year over a scandal. Children of revolutionary leaders have also made their mark &#8212; and fortunes &#8212; as China&#8217;s economy soared, heading China&#8217;s most powerful banks and State-run corporations.\nZhang Lifan has closely followed their changing stories over the turbulent past six decades of the People&#8217;s Republic from a unique vantage point. A historian by training, he spent many years at the influential Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \nHe subsequently left the academy to become an independent and outspoken commentator. His father, Zhang Naiqi, was an eminent activist and pro-democracy politician, who was purged during the anti-Rightist campaign of the late 1950s.\nIn the past few decades, he has watched his contemporaries &#8212; many of whom witnessed similar horrors inflicted on their parents by Mao Zedong&#8217;s foot soldiers &#8212; rise to the top of China&#8217;s political system.\nTheir Red background, he says, will inform their decision-making, and likely emerge as both an asset and a liability.\n&#8220;I come from the same political environment and time as the Princelings,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They want to have a strongman to lead the CPC out of today&#8217;s troubles. They are reluctant about diluting their political control, but they know they need economic growth to enhance their legitimacy. But they are facing a dilemma, because they know liberalisation of economics will lead to social and political democratic demands.&#8221;\nMr. Xi is already demonstrating &#8220;authority we did not see in Hu&#8217;s era&#8221; by centralising decision-making. Only on Monday, Mr. Xi was chosen by the Politburo to head &#8220;a leading group for overall reform&#8221; that will set policies for economic and political reforms. Under Mr. Hu Jintao, however, economic responsibility was shared with the Chinese Premier or head of the government, Wen Jiabao.\n&#8220;What is happening is that power is being moved out of the Politburo out to other institutions, such as the reform leading group or the newly established national security commission, to give Xi greater authority,&#8221; Professor Zhang said.\nWhile Mr. Xi&#8217;s &#8220;political capital&#8221; may, in a sense, hence emerge as an asset, enabling more nimble and centralised policy planning, Professor Zhang said it is also a liability when it comes to the issue of political reforms and bringing much-needed checks to the untrammelled power at the top of the party.\n&#8220;The princelings are like a family, so they worry about the party&#8217;s interests the most,&#8221; he said. \n&#8220;If you look at the anti-corruption campaign, there is such a concern about external supervision that they are attempting to solve the problem only within the system.

(496, '281', 'December 30, 2013', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-mao-legacy-and-chinas-reforms-future/article5515752.ece', 'The Communist Party of China (CPC) finds itself in an awkward position as it goes forward after commemorating the 120th birth anniversary of the most important of its founding fathers. A year ago, the CPC&#8217;s propaganda chiefs decreed that Mao Zedong&#8217;s 120th birth anniversary, which fell on December 26, would be celebrated with fanfare, aimed at underlining the Great Helmsman&#8217;s lasting contributions in founding a new China and, at the same time, boosting the party&#8217;s legitimacy at a time when it is struggling to renew its ideological appeal.\nBut in the weeks leading up to the anniversary, the party appeared to have had a change of heart. First, the official broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV), said it would cancel a long-planned 100-episode television series about the life of Mao, scheduled to coincide with his birth anniversary. Then, the CPC&#8217;s new leader, President Xi Jinping, on a visit to Mao&#8217;s native Hunan province told provincial officials any planned celebrations needed to be &#8220;pragmatic.&#8221;\nWhat is clear is that Mao&#8217;s legacy continues to be a divisive issue in China. For those on the conservative Left, Mao&#8217;s political authoritarianism is often framed as a platform to oppose economic and political reforms, which they view as a fundamental threat to the party&#8217;s future. Those on the liberal Right, who favour market reforms and political loosening, see his persisting political legacy as an obstacle.\nThe Party under Mr. Xi finds itself caught in the middle, the respected economist Mao Yushi told <i>The Hindu </i>in an interview. &#8220;Today,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the party is facing many contradictions. Mao Zedong&#8217;s path, and the CPC&#8217;s path, are different. Mao Zedong believed in the need to establish an equal society. Now we have an unequal society. Mao believed in Communism. Today, the party follows Capitalism. So there is a contradiction.&#8221;\nMao Yushi has, over the past two decades, become one of China&#8217;s most influential intellectuals. An economist by training, the 84-year-old retired scholar (no relation to Mao Zedong) heads the pro-reform Unirule Institute of Economics in Beijing, which he established with four other economists two decades ago when China was beginning to embark on its second round of reforms. Famed in China as an economist &#8212; several of his works have become best-sellers there &#8212; he has also emerged as the country&#8217;s most prominent critic of Maoism in recent years. Two years ago, he faced threats to his life as several thousand Mao supporters put forward a petition demanding his arrest after he wrote a brave article criticising Mao&#8217;s legacy. Unsurprisingly, he sees &#8220;Mao&#8217;s supporters&#8221; as &#8220;the biggest threat&#8221; to the CPC &#8212; and one reason behind the restrained celebrations this year. &#8220;Mao&#8217;s supporters think our road today is completely wrong. So there is no way the ruling party can celebrate this anniversary as a big event.&#8221;\nProfessor Mao sees the party&#8217;s new leader, Mr. Xi Jinping, who has now been in office for a little over a year, as appearing &#8220;confused&#8221; about plotting a course forward, leaving &#8220;both liberals and Maoists disappointed.&#8221; On Thursday, December 26, Mr. Xi seemed to attempt a careful balancing act in a speech at a symposium to mark Mao&#8217;s anniversary held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing &#8212; just about the only official event to commemorate the occasion. While he defended Mao&#8217;s legacy by describing him as &#8220;a great figure who changed the face of the nation and led the Chinese people to a new destiny,&#8221; he also said &#8220;revolutionary leaders are not gods, but human beings.&#8221; \nIn the year he has been in office, Mr. Xi has made clear he plans to go forward with economic reforms that include boosting the role of the market and trimming the power of the influential state-run sector, according to an ambitious blueprint unveiled at the Central Committee&#8217;s third plenum in November. Mr. Xi has himself sought to invoke comparisons with former leader Deng Xiaoping, who unveiled China&#8217;s reforms at another third plenum meeting, in 1978. At the same time, he also hit out at those questioning Mao Zedong&#8217;s legacy and seeking to negate the results of the first 30 years of the CPC&#8217;s history &#8212; a turbulent time that saw the Great Leap Forward (1958) that resulted in famine and tens of millions of deaths, and the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) where Mao&#8217;s Red Guards persecuted millions.\nMao Yushi, however, believes that enabling the Chinese people to have a true understanding of Mao Zedong&#8217;s legacy is crucial for the country&#8217;s political future. In 2011, he penned an article arguing for the restoration of &#8220;Mao Zedong as a man,&#8221; highlighting his direct responsibility for the famine and the Cultural Revolution, events which find &#8220;no mention in our textbooks.&#8221; He said the first 30 years of new China were &#8220;a misery,&#8221; while &#8220;the backstage boss who destroyed the country still has his portrait on Tiananmen Square.&#8221; His article triggered a storm of controversy, angering Party mouthpieces, conservatives and the Left, but winning praise from historians and progressives. Although he faced death threats and calls from neo-Maoists for his arrest, the Chinese government did not take any action.\n&#8220;The government tries to cover Mao&#8217;s crimes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In textbooks, there is nothing about Mao&#8217;s crimes. It never talks about the three years&#8217; great famine, how many people died. The young generation does not know the past history. The history they study is fabricated history, so it gets people&#8217;s ideas very confused&#8221; about the need for political reforms and democratisation. &#8220;The future of change in China on the political side,&#8221; he added, &#8220;depends on how big is the force of the pro-Mao people. Economic change depends on how strong vested interest groups are.&#8221;\nHe sees state-owned Enterprises (SOEs), which still control vast swathes of the economy, as the biggest interest group. &#8220;The SOEs sector &#8212; railways, energy, communication &#8212; is very strong. The price they set, whether the interest rate, or power price, is by themselves. So they earn a big profit, not because of their efficiency but because they monopolise the sector.&#8221; Mao Yushi and many other Chinese economists see SOE reform as a key step towards addressing China&#8217;s economic imbalances, as the country attempts to move away from a State-investment driven model, promote innovation and address widening inequality.\nMr. Xi, in the November plenum, took a tentative step towards curbing SOE power, by declaring they will have to return a greater share of their profits and opening them up to private capital. But Professor Mao says the move will not have much impact, pointing out that 20 years ago, when profits had to be returned to the government, SOEs simply &#8220;used up all their profits.&#8221;\n&#8220;If you look at Singapore or France, SOEs are efficient because they are totally separated from the government. In our case, they are just one body, so this is the problem. Board members of these SOEs come from the government. They exchange positions because board members earn 10 million Yuan (Rs.10 crore) a year, but as a minister earn may be a hundred thousand. The board members are told by the government, &#8216;You take this position, earn 10 million year, come back after three years and let someone else take the position!&#8217;&#8221;\nProfessor Mao thinks that &#8220;economically it is clear China is going in the direction of a more open and liberal way.&#8221; &#8220;Politically, generally there are some improvements towards greater rule of law, but Mr. Xi&#8217;s long-term vision in political terms is not clear.&#8221; He believes that the decade under Mr. Xi may not &#8220;bring big reforms,&#8221; but &#8220;the next generation 10 years on could bring a big change.&#8221; &#8220;If you look at Taiwan, when officials who studied overseas came back and took high positions, like [President] Ma Ying-jeou, the political environment changed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In China&#8217;s case, one or two ministers are overseas returned, but that number is going up very fast.&#8221;\n<i>ananth.krishnan@thehindu.co.in</i>', '120th,important,fanfare,new,same,ideological,anniversary,birth,new,native,provincial,clear,divisive,conservative,political,economic,political,fundamental,liberal,political,political,many,equal,unequal,past,influential,other,second,several,prominent,critic,recent,several,anniversary,big,new,careful,only,great,new,human,economic,influential,ambitious,third,former,third,same,first,true,crucial,political,direct,first,new,great,many,young,past,political,future,political,big,strong,vast,big,many,other,Chinese,key,economic,tentative,private,much,efficient,clear,open,liberal,political,big,next,big,overseas,high,political,overseas,', ' ambitious careful efficient fanfare great important influential liberal open prominent strong true vast', ' critic divisive tentative', 13, -3, 10, 16),

Under the reeducation through labour system, accused can be held for up to four years without a trial.\n\n\nWhile initially introduced in the 1950s to hold those charged with minor crimes, critics of the system say it had been subsequently expanded to subvert the law by effectively imprisoning citizens without any recourse to a fair hearing. Law enforcement agencies have often sentenced citizens petitioning higher authorities to have their grievances heard to reeducation through labour to silence them.\n\n\nAs of this year, around 1.6 lakh people were held in some 260 labour camps. It still remains unclear what will become of the camps and those detained. Chinese media reports said some facilities will be turned into drug rehabilitation centres offering &#8220;compulsory&#8221; treatment.\n\n\nThe NPC on Saturday also passed a resolution loosening family planning restrictions. The move will allow couples to have a second child if either parent is an only child. \n\nUnder the earlier family planning policy, couples could have two children only if both parents were from one-child families. In rural areas, couples can have two children if their first born is a girl.\n\n\nThe resolution does not mean an end to China&#8217;s vast family planning regime, which continues to be enforced by a powerful bureaucracy and remains a source of billions of Yuan to the authorities from fines.\n\n\nThe loosening of the policy does, however, reflect the government&#8217;s anxieties about declining birth rates and a shrinking labour force. The working population will fall by 8 million every year after 2023, the government said, with those above 60 years of age reaching 400 million and accounting for one-quarter of the population in the next two decades.\n', 'controversial,key,new,top,legislative,effective,minor,unclear,second,only,rural,first,powerful,birth,next,', ' effective powerful top', ' controversial unclear', 3, -2, 1, 5),

Tens of millions were also persecuted during the decade-long Cultural Revolution (1966-76), as Mao&#8217;s Red Guards rampaged across China as he consolidated his power and eliminated his rivals.\n\n\nAmong those who faced persecution then was Mr. Xi&#8217;s father, Xi Zhongxun, who later emerged as an influential liberal leader and supporter of economic reforms.\n\n\nAs a member of the increasingly influential group of &#8220;princelings&#8221; &#8211; or second Red generation leaders as they are known in China &#8211; Mr. Xi has been careful to defend Mao&#8217;s legacy, seeing it as an issue tied to the Communist Party&#8217;s own legitimacy.\n\n\nOn Thursday, he elaborately described Mao&#8217;s contributions in &#8220;revolution, anti-imperial and anti-feudal struggles, and building a Socialist society.&#8221;\n\n\nAs to Mao&#8217;s failures, Mr. Xi only said: &#8220;Comrade Mao Zedong&#8217;s mistakes in his later years have their subjective factors and personal responsibility, and complicated social and historical reasons both at home and abroad also played their part. They should be viewed and analysed comprehensively, historically and dialectically&#8221;.\n\n\n&#8220;We should not simply attribute the success in historical favourable circumstances to individuals, nor should we blame individuals for setbacks in adverse situation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We cannot use today&#8217;s conditions and level of development and understanding to judge our predecessors, nor can we expect the predecessors to have done things that only the successors can do&#8221;.\n\n\nFor the party, the idea of Mao remains a central platform in its official propaganda, even though, in reality, the CPC has discarded Maoism as it pushed forward economic reforms.

We must give more attention to economic and cultural relations, which are more important than political and strategic ties,&#8221; he said. \n This would create a constructive environment for future development of bilateral ties, he said. &#8220;China has borders with 14 countries of which we attach great importance to our relationship with Russia and India,&#8221; he said. He pointed out that trade between China and India last year was $66 billion. &#8220;Our collective population is 2.5 billion, yet we have as much trade with Singapore that has a population of five million,&#8221; he said. It would be difficult to touch the 2015 target of $100 billion even by 2020. \nLast year&#8217;s trade deficit in favour of China was $28 billion. It reached $24.7 billion by September, this year. Indian exports to China have seen a 22.5 per cent drop until September.\n&#8220;We are looking for industrial parks on the lines of what China has. These are different from what India has. China gives much more security to industry,&#8221; he said... The larger investment environment in India is difficult to change and is beyond our reach. What we can do is to create a China style park here,&#8221; Mr. Wei said adding that visits to M.P. and other States were primarily to find a location for such a park.\nLiu Bin, Deputy Director of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, told <i>The Hindu </i>that Chinese parks received tax holidays and assistance in construction. &#8220;They are very large and have all the suppliers in one place considerably reducing costs,&#8221; he said.

You need to be patient and not leave what you have started, to succeed,&#8221; he advised. The MP government has offered five probable sites in Bhopal, Indore and Gwalior districts.

The Cowpens was, itself, sailing near the Liaoning, China&#8217;s first aircraft carrier, which has been deployed in the South China Sea, where the incident took place on December 5.\nOn Monday, Chinese officials responded by accusing the U.S. of provoking the Chinese navy, saying the Cowpens was &#8220;harassing&#8221; the Liaoning and had entered &#8220;within 45 km of the inner defence layer&#8221; of the Chinese fleet.\n&#8220;The USS Cowpens was tailing after and harassing the Liaoning formation.

When Mr. Hu took over in 2002, Mr. Zhou was appointed Minister of Public Security, moved out of Sichuan province and promoted under the orders of the former President Jiang Zemin, Mr. Hu&#8217;s predecessor.\n\n\nIn 2007, he was promoted to the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee, and given charge of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee (PLAC), a powerful body in charge of the domestic security apparatus, from the police to the judiciary.

(518, '281', 'December 10, 2013', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/not-just-about-the-islands/article5441185.ece', '\nIn late November, China announced that it now had an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea. This development led to an immediate spiking of tensions with its neighbours, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as with the United States. \n\nIn response, the United States sent two B-52 bombers into the air zone claimed by China. A couple of days later, Japan and South Korea followed suit, sending aircraft into the zone without informing the Chinese authorities. While the U.S. has now at least advised its passenger airlines to follow the rules of the Chinese ADIZ, Tokyo has explicitly refused to do so. For those bemused by China&#8217;s sudden announcement and the flurry of international attention that has accompanied it, here is a handy guide to the issue.\n\n\n<b>What is an ADIZ?</b>\n\n\nIt&#8217;s a section of international airspace over which a country declares its right to identify aircraft, ostensibly to protect itself from foreign threat. It&#8217;s a product of customary international law but it&#8217;s not jurisdictional.\n\n\n<b>What happens once an ADIZ is established?</b>\n\n\nA country would use radar to detect unexpected aircraft flying in the ADIZ and observe them. This would sort some, if not most, into the category of being unthreatening. Using radio, it would query those it was concerned about. The country may ask who they are and what they are doing. If they are not a security threat, that would be sufficient. If the country was still not sure, it would launch an aircraft to intercept and observe. The country would not have the authority to do anything else unless it thought the aircraft was a direct threat to the country.\n\n\n<b>What&#8217;s the problem with China declaring an ADIZ?</b>\n\n\nWell, the problem is that China&#8217;s ADIZ overlaps with the ADIZ that was created by the U.S. after World War-II and transferred to Japan in 1969. Japan sees this as an affront to its sovereignty. The bigger problem is that China&#8217;s ADIZ encompasses the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands claimed by both China and Japan. This is the first time an overlapping ADIZ has been declared in an area where there is a sovereignty dispute. As a result, with China monitoring the space, and the U.S. and China&#8217;s neighbours defying it, there is now an increased risk of either a deliberate or accidental incident involving military aircraft. Some are also concerned that China thinks the ADIZ will strengthen its claim over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands.\n\n\n<b>Is it Diaoyu or Senkaku? And what&#8217;s the history issue that crops up in every article?</b>\n\n\nThe Chinese call the islands Diaoyudao. The Japanese call them Senkaku. Impartial observers try to get both names in. The &#8220;history problem&#8221; (lishi wenti) as China terms it, refers to the history of Japanese colonialism in China. Japan, once a vassal state of imperial China, subjugated and humiliated the Chinese not once but twice in different periods of time &#8212; in the late 1800s, and again, in the 1930s. Japan&#8217;s domination and exploitation of China, along with the conquests of Western powers, falls under the &#8220;century of humiliation&#8221; (bainian guochi) in the Chinese historical narrative. \n\nThe Diaoyudao islands were considered lost during this period when Japan formally annexed them in 1895. The suffering at the hands of Japan was particularly shocking for China and the issue remains hugely sensitive, not just because Japan was considered an inferior vassal state at the beginning of this tumultuous period, but also because modern Japan is seen as unremorseful of the atrocities it inflicted on China.\n\n\n<b>So why did China suddenly declare the ADIZ? Is it just about controlling Diaoyu/Senkaku?</b>\n\n\nThat depends on whom you talk to. Chinese foreign policy decision-making is highly opaque, so all anyone can do is to speculate and there have been a number of speculative theories. First, China could be redefining the status quo. China feels it has a right to an ADIZ to protect its sovereignty over both its territory as well as its claimed maritime spaces. After all, Japan has an ADIZ. \n\nMoreover, Japan&#8217;s ADIZ comes within 130 km of China&#8217;s territory; therefore it&#8217;s only fair that China&#8217;s ADIZ extends to within 130 km of Japan&#8217;s territory. Second, it could be a direct challenge to Japan&#8217;s administration of Diaoyu/Senkaku. Japan has administrative control over the islands; this could be China&#8217;s attempt at a different kind of parallel control.\n\n\nThird, this could be not about Diaoyu/Senkaku but rather about bigger maritime security issues in the East China Sea and asserting Chinese dominance. The New York Times quoted an unnamed adviser to President Obama saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty clear this isn&#8217;t about the islands.&#8221; \n\nFourth, it could be a combination of domestic political pressure from Chinese nationalists in the media and the PLA, and President Xi Jinping feeling his way into his new role. Japan is a domestic hot button issue and any move by the government that could be interpreted as pushback against Japan would appeal to a small but highly vocal section of nationalists in the media as well as the PLA, which tends to take stronger stances on Chinese territorial sovereignty than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That, combined with President Xi&#8217;s relatively new leadership, could be a way for him to consolidate his authority.\n\n\n<b>What does this mean for India?</b>\n\n\nWell, hawks would immediately jump to the conclusion that China is more aggressive in its foreign policy, which does not bode well for its relations with India. Certainly, China&#8217;s announcement of the ADIZ was unexpected. It was done without any consultation with Japan and has thus been seen as very disrespectful. It has also been called unnecessary. Since the ADIZ is not jurisdictional, it makes no legal difference to China&#8217;s claim over Diaoyu/Senkaku. \n\nA more sober look, however, would take into account a few additional facts. First, many countries have an ADIZ and establishing one is not surprising in itself. It&#8217;s possible the Chinese government did not realise that the establishment of the ADIZ would lead to this strong backlash. In their eyes, they were establishing parity with Japan, not needling it. Second, China backed off from their initial terming of the ADIZ as &#8220;emergency defensive measures&#8221; and insisted that they just want notification from aircraft entering the airspace, and are not about to respond with force. \n\nThird, as The Diplomat pointed out, China is engaging in &#8220;lawfare&#8221; &#8212; using international institutions to achieve strategic goals. This is indicative of acceptance rather than the rejection of the current international order. Fourth, because China, like all other countries, has a right to an ADIZ, the ADIZ itself should not be the problem. Rather, China&#8217;s actions should be scrutinised. \n\nIf Japanese planes flying towards Diaoyu/Senkaku are intercepted on a regular basis, that would be more of an issue than the establishment of the ADIZ itself, unexpected though it may have been. Last, unpalatable as this may be to the Indian power elite, given the focus on the &#8220;China threat&#8221;, India, currently at least, simply does not factor into China&#8217;s strategic priorities. China is intently focused on the United States. Implicitly, this may actually be a good thing, leading to maintenance of the status quo for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n<i>(Manjari Chatterjee Miller is Assistant Professor of International Relations, Boston University, and author of </i>Wronged by Empire: Post-Imperial Ideology and Foreign Policy in India and China.<i>)</i>\n', 'late,immediate,later,sudden,international,international,foreign,customary,international,sure,direct,first,accidental,military,Japanese,imperial,different,late,Western,Chinese,historical,sensitive,inferior,tumultuous,modern,unremorseful,foreign,opaque,speculative,fair,direct,administrative,different,parallel,Chinese,domestic,political,new,domestic,small,vocal,Chinese,territorial,new,aggressive,foreign,jurisdictional,legal,few,additional,many,surprising,possible,strong,initial,defensive,international,strategic,indicative,current,international,other,regular,unpalatable,strategic,good,foreseeable,', ' fair good imperial modern sensitive strong sure', ' accidental defensive inferior tumultuous', 7, -4, 3, 11),

Both countries have made clear they would contest China&#8217;s zone by dispatching aircraft to carry out patrols through the area. China last week said it had scrambled jets to intercept at least 12 Japanese and U.S. aircraft.\n Seoul&#8217;s announcement on Sunday was seen as an attempt to bolster its control over parts of the East China Sea surrounding the Leodo reef, which, earlier, lay beyond the southern edge of its zone. The eastern and western limits of its ADIZ have not been expanded.\n The South Korean Defence Ministry in a statement said the new ADIZ was &#8220;designed to have its southern boundary match the country&#8217;s broader flight information region (FIR), and includes airspace over the South-controlled reef of Leodo and the islands of Marado and Hongdo,&#8221; the Seoul-based Yonhap news agency said. The government said the expanded zone would go into effect starting December 15, and would not impose restrictions on civilian flights.\n The Defence Ministry said it had &#8220;offered sufficient explanations to related countries&#8221;. President Park Geun-hye is thought to have briefed U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on the move during talks on Friday. Mr.\n Biden was in South Korea following stops in Tokyo and Beijing. His three-nation tour was aimed at boosting economic ties and reinforcing U.S. interests in the Pacific, although the visit was overshadowed by the tensions surrounding the ADIZ issue.\n Mr. Biden was quoted as saying by Yonhap that he &#8220;appreciated President Park&#8217;s explanation and South Korea&#8217;s efforts&#8221;. An unnamed South Korean official added that he was of the view that South Korea&#8217;s ties with China, which had also been briefed about the move, would not &#8220;deteriorate seriously&#8221; because of the issue.\n Chinese officials have defended their move by pointing to Japan&#8217;s already established - and larger - ADIZ in the East China Sea.\n However, doubts about certain aspects regarding how China planned to enforce its control within the ADIZ raised anxieties. For instance, the Chinese government said it would take unspecified &#8220;emergency&#8221; defence measures if aircraft entered the zone without filing flight plans with Chinese authorities.\n Even as Chinese officials have hit out at Tokyo for making &#8220;irresponsible remarks&#8221; about the issue, they have appeared to adopt a far more measured tone regarding concerns expressed by South Korea.\n Asked how China would respond to a move by South Korea to expand its airspace, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei told reporters on Friday China was &#8220;ready to stay in communication&#8221; with Seoul &#8220;based on the principle of equality and mutual respect&#8221;. He did, also, appear to rule out talks with Japan on the issue. &#8220;The point is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Japan does not face up to history and reality, and fails to adopt the correct approach on relevant issues&#8221;.', 'first,apparent,first,such,regional,many,northeastern,northern,territorial,international,territorial,submerged,last,Japanese,western,new,civilian,related,economic,certain,unspecified,Chinese,Chinese,far,mutual,relevant,', ' relevant', ' unspecified', 1, -1, 0, 2),

That the ADIZ so marked includes the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands &#8212; whose ownership is contested by China and Japan &#8212; has riled Japan and the U.S., prompting Washington to send B-52 bombers over the Zone. China admittedly is well within its rights to demarcate such an ADIZ. Air defence identification zones serve as buffer airspace for countries, extending in some cases beyond territorial waters. It is the prerogative of littoral states to determine how they should respond to civilian or military aircraft entering an ADIZ. The U.S. and Canada have identified air defence zones that cover hundreds of miles beyond their territorial seas &#8212; the U.S., however, maintains that only military aircraft are required to inform the authorities while crossing this space and that too if they intend to fly towards the mainland. India has marked six such zones hugging its coastline, with stringent clearance requirements for all aircraft entering them. Whether China has unilaterally implemented an ADIZ is inconsequential and it is conceivable that air defence zones of neighbouring countries may overlap. Japan, for instance, identified an ADIZ bordering Taiwan earlier this year without consulting Taipei, stoking a controversy.\n\n\nThe question, then, is not one of legality but propriety. Some directives contained in China&#8217;s ADIZ announcement were rather alarming. China&#8217;s announcement that its &#8220;armed forces would adopt defensive emergency measures&#8221; &#8212; presumably going well beyond identification or interception &#8212; against non-cooperating aircraft, was problematic especially in the light of a standing dispute over some territories in the Zone. The Chinese government may have intended to remind the U.S. that it is the dominant power in the region. Yet ironically, this episode has brought the U.S. and its allies together in a huddle. Beijing must also now contend with its increasingly vocal nationalist constituency that has been demanding &#8220;countermeasures&#8221; against violating aircraft. The U.S. too must desist from creating further friction in the region. After an initial display of bravado in sending bomber planes over the ADIZ, the U.S. has asked its commercial aircraft to &#8220;operate consistent with notices to airmen issued by foreign countries.&#8221; China should now respond in kind and assuage the legitimate concerns of its Asian neighbours.

A six-wheeled rover will then roll down from the lander and set off across the lunar surface.\nInfluential Chinese scientists began urging their Government to undertake a programme of lunar exploration in the early 1990s. But the Communist Party&#8217;s Central Committee finally gave the go-ahead only a decade later, in January 2004.\nChina&#8217;s current lunar programme involves three stages &#8212; orbiting the Moon, landing on its surface and, finally, bringing back lunar samples.\nIn 2007, a year before India launched its Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe, China sent the Chang&#8217;e-1 spacecraft to image and study the Moon from orbit. \nThree years later, the Chang&#8217;e-2 was despatched, which too orbited the Moon and took high-resolution images that helped choose the landing site for its successor. \nAfter the spacecraft&#8217;s primary mission was completed, its controllers sent it about 1.5 million km from Earth. Thereafter, it conducted a fly-by of the asteroid Toutatis about seven million km from Earth. The Chang&#8217;e-2 was currently about 60 million km away and would travel to a distance of 300 million km, according to a senior Chinese official quoted in a Xinhua news agency report.\nThe Chang&#8217;e-3&#8217;s lander, which is now on its way to the Moon, will use a liquid propellant engine, with variable thrust, to slow the spacecraft as it descends to the lunar surface. The lander has been provided with an autonomous capability to hover above the lunar surface, check for obstacles below and, if necessary, to move away from them before touching down, according to a paper published by Chinese space scientists.\n&#8220;Autonomous hazard avoidance is a capability that NASA has tested on Earth, but has not yet flown on any lander spacecraft,&#8221; commented Dwayne Day, an American space historian and analyst, in an article in <i>The Space Review</i>, an online publication.\nApart from transporting the rover, the lander is carrying a near-ultraviolet telescope for astronomical observations as well as an extreme ultraviolet camera to observe a region of charged particles around Earth.\nThe 140-kg rover has a robotic arm that can analyse the chemical composition of lunar rocks and soil. It also carries a ground-penetrating radar to provide information about the Moon''s crust.\nBoth the lander and rover are equipped with radioisotope heating units, containing radioactive plutonium-238, to keep them warm during the long lunar nights when temperatures can plunge to -150 degrees Celsius. This will be another important first for China as radioisotope-based systems to produce electricity and for heating spacecraft are widely used in deep space missions.\nThis mission will be followed by another lander-rover effort, the Chang''e-4. Then, with the Chang''e-5 currently scheduled for 2017, China will attempt to bring back lunar rock and soil samples.\nGiven China&#8217;s steady progress in manned space, many believe that its next step will be to land astronauts on the Moon. Indeed, Ouyang Ziyuan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who played a key role in promoting lunar exploration, has been quoted as saying that manned missions would follow.\n&#8220;I do not believe China has made a decision on a human lunar mission,&#8221; observed Gregory Kulacki, China project manager and senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S.-based nonprofit science advocacy group.\nChina&#8217;s space station was the terminal goal of its current manned spaceflight programme, and would keep its space planners occupied for more than a decade, he pointed out in an email. There were also some doubts emerging about the value of the human programme relative to other emerging space priorities.\nBesides, &#8220;China appears to prefer an international, collaborative effort when discussing possible human lunar missions, rather than going alone,&#8221; remarked Dr. Kulacki, who has written extensively about its space programme.', 'major,soft,technological,controlled,flat,early,later,current,lunar,later,primary,asteroid,senior,Chinese,variable,autonomous,necessary,Chinese,astronomical,charged,robotic,chemical,radioactive,long,important,first,used,lunar,steady,many,next,key,manned,human,senior,terminal,current,human,relative,other,international,collaborative,possible,', ' autonomous important necessary steady', '', 4, 0, 4, 4);

The U.S. Vice President will arrive in Beijing on Wednesday and hold talks with the Chinese leadership, before travelling to South Korea later in the week.\n\n\nWhile the White House said in a statement the visit was aimed at reaffirming the U.S. as a Pacific power, promoting trade, and underscoring its commitment to "rebalancing" its foreign policy towards Asia, last week''s decision by China is set to dominate the trip''s agenda.\n\n\nIn Tokyo, Mr. Biden said on Tuesday China&#8217;s move had &#8220;raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation&#8221;, speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\n\n&#8220;This underscores the need for crisis management mechanisms and effective channels of communication between China and Japan to reduce the risk of escalation,&#8221; he said, adding that he would directly raise the issue during his visit to Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\nChina, on November 23, announced the setting up of its first ADIZ, reasoning that other countries, such as Japan and South Korea, had already set up such zones in the region. The ADIZ is not a territorial claim, but a defined area in international airspace, extending beyond a country&#8217;s airspace, within which it tracks and identifies aircraft heading into its territory.\n\n\nHowever, ambiguity about how China planned to administer its ADIZ, which also includes islands at the centre of a dispute with Japan and a reef under South Korean control, last week fuelled tensions, with Beijing saying it would launch unspecified "emergency defence responses" to any aircraft that entered the zone without notifying Chinese authorities.\n\n\nIn recent days, the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have all made clear they will not follow China&#8217;s rules, and have deployed military aircraft to carry out patrols through the Chinese ADIZ. China said it had responded by "identifying the aircraft", and had also dispatched fighter jets to tail 12 American and Japanese aircraft.\n\n\nThe Chinese Defence Ministry on Tuesday released a statement rebutting the criticism from several countries blaming Beijing for fanning regional tensions.\n\n\n&#8220;We have noticed that a very few countries have said that China&#8217;s setting up of the East China Sea ADIZ has unilaterally altered the East China Sea&#8217;s status quo, and escalated regional tension,&#8221; the statement from spokesperson Geng Yansheng said.\n\n\nReferring to Japan establishing its own ADIZ &#8220;as early as 1969&#8221; and expanding &#8220;its scope many times to only 130 km toward our coastline from its west end, which covers most of the airspace of the East China Sea&#8221;, he said Tokyo was &#8220;not qualified at all to make irresponsible remarks".\n\n\nThe view among many diplomats in Beijing is that even if the Chinese government was well within its rights to set up an ADIZ &#8211; almost all of its neighbours have already done so &#8211; it would have been better served by consulting and informing its neighbours before hand.\n\n\nThe lack of detail in what &#8220;emergency&#8221; defence responses might be launched by the Chinese air force &#8211; whether such moves would only include identification or, on the other hand, involve scrambling of jets &#8211; was also seen as provoking concerns.\n\n\nThe Defence Ministry statement appeared to try and address those anxieties, even if it had perhaps come one week too late. It said, &#8220;generally, supervision and control are exercised through reported flight plans and radar response and identification&#8221;, adding that &#8220;fighter planes are unnecessary when an entering aircraft is found to pose no threat to us&#8221;. &#8220;It is well-known that civil flights pose no threat in most circumstances,&#8221; the statement added.\n\n\nDespite stirring tensions in the short-term, analysts here see the ADIZ move as aimed at a longer-term objective: questioning Japan&#8217;s control over the disputed Senkaku or Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea, currently administered by Tokyo, and boosting Chinese capabilities to patrol in the waters and skies surrounding the islands.\n\n\nWhile the Defence Ministry said the zone was not &#8220;aimed at any specific country&#8221;, it did, however, blame Japan for "making trouble&#8221; over the islands, starting with announcing its &#8220;purchase&#8221; of the islands in September 2012 from a private owner and &#8220;frequently sending vessels and planes to disturb Chinese ships and planes in normal exercises or training&#8221;.\n\n\n&#8220;Japan&#8217;s actions have seriously harmed China&#8217;s legitimate rights and security interests,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;China has to take necessary reactions&#8221;.\n', 'regional,first,American,Chinese,later,foreign,last,regional,joint,effective,first,other,such,such,territorial,international,last,unspecified,Chinese,recent,clear,military,American,Japanese,several,regional,few,regional,own,many,irresponsible,many,such,other,flight,unnecessary,civil,Chinese,specific,private,Chinese,normal,legitimate,necessary,', ' civil effective legitimate necessary normal', ' irresponsible unnecessary unspecified', 5, -3, 2, 8),

Defence Ministry spokesperson Geng Yangsheng told reporters Chinese armed forces had "monitored the entire process".\n\n\nYet it remains unclear whether "identification" by armed forces is the only action China intends to take when aircraft enter the zone. \n\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang told reporters that "different and corresponding measures" would be employed for "different occasions".\n\n\nDiplomats from three countries said the Saturday announcement by China came as a surprise, suggesting that Beijing may have been better served by bringing countries in the region on board first before rolling out its plan. Failure to do so, coupled with persisting ambiguity about China''s plans to enforce its claims, had needlessly stirred regional anxieties, they suggested.\n\n\nMr. Qin of the Foreign Ministry said "relevant countries" had been notified before Saturday''s announcement, although he declined to name them.\n\n\nBut sources said countries such as South Korea and Japan were told only a few hours before the formal announcement on Saturday morning. \n\nJapan, which is involved in territorial disputes with China over the Senkaku or Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea - the islands lie within both countries'' air defence zones, which are overlapping - has warned that the move could result in "unexpected" incidents. Both countries have already had run-ins between naval vessels, while Japan recently scrambled fighter jets and threatened to shoot down a Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.\n\n\nThe U.S., for its part, has made clear that its aircraft will not follow China''s demands, and will only adhere to its own regulations which state that aircraft only need to notify countries if they are heading towards their airspace, not when they are merely transiting through such zones.\n\n\nEven South Korea, which has recently enjoyed warming ties with China, has expressed "regret" and concern over the move, as the ADIZ also overlaps with its own air defence zone.\n\n\nRory Medcalf, Director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, said the move would likely make tensions over the disputed East China Sea islands "even harder to manage".\n\n\n"An ADIZ is not a provocative or negative step in itself; indeed, it can be in the interests of stability and security of the nation enforcing it," he wrote in an article posted on the institute''s website, pointing that the U.S., Japan and South Korea had already set up similar zones.\n\n\n"If China&#8217;s new zone did not include disputed maritime territory, if its requirements for compliance applied only to aircraft heading into Chinese airspace, and if neighbours like Japan and South Korea had been consulted ahead of the announcement, then there would be little or nothing for others to object to," he added. Instead, the move was "a unilateral step, announced suddenly and apparently without consultation with two countries whose civilian and military aircraft will be most affected, the US and Japan." \n\nOn Wednesday, the question remained as to why Beijing even took the step of risking fanning regional tensions with the announcement if it planned to only "identify" aircraft and not intercept them - as it did to the two B-52s on Tuesday.\n\n\nIn fact, the move comes at a time when the new Chinese leadership has launched a charm offensive to bolster ties with neighbours and tone down tensions over the South China Sea, where China has, in recent years, had run-ins with vessels from Vietnam and the Philippines. \n\nPresident Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang recently travelled to Southeast Asia promising to expand trade and investment, and reached an agreement with Vietnam on joint exploration in the South China Sea, which is contested by more than 10 countries. \n\nMr. Qin said China may also consider setting up similar air defence zones to fortify its other frontiers after "completing preparations". This could, analysts suggested, include parts of the South China Sea.\n\n\nSuch a move would be certain to inflame tensions.\n\n\nAs air defence zones generally extend beyond a country''s territory into international airspace, it is less likely that China will take the more provocative step of setting up such a zone across its western or northern frontiers, where it shares land borders with India, Russia and a number of Central Asian countries.\n', 'regional,American,close,Chinese,entire,unclear,only,different,different,regional,relevant,such,few,formal,territorial,Chinese,own,such,own,provocative,negative,website,similar,new,Chinese,unilateral,civilian,military,regional,new,Chinese,recent,joint,similar,other,certain,international,likely,provocative,such,northern,', ' relevant', ' close negative provocative unclear', 1, -4, -3, 5),

He described the ADIZ move as a &#8220;recent and sudden" step that had "caused significant apprehension in the region".\n\n\nSenior U.S. administration officials said Mr. Biden had indicated to the Chinese &#8220;deep concerns&#8221; on how the U.S. saw the ADIZ, and also &#8220;made clear&#8221; that the U.S. and other countries were looking at China &#8220;to take steps to lower tensions&#8221; and avoid &#8220;enforcement actions that could lead to a crisis&#8221;.\n\n\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei told reporters on Thursday China &#8220;reiterated its principled position&#8221; during the talks. &#8220;We pointed out this action is in line with international laws and conventions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The U.S. should respect that.&#8221;\n\n\nMr. Biden had lengthy discussions with Mr. Xi stretching over more than five and a half hours on Wednesday evening, with two hours of restricted-level talks followed by a 90-minute expanded meeting and a two-hour working dinner.\n\n\nThe senior administration officials, at a background briefing, expressed cautious optimism that even if China went ahead with its plan, all sides would take steps to tone down tensions.\n\n\nMr. Xi, the officials said, &#8220;listened carefully to the Vice President&#8217;s arguments about the need to create a more conducive environment too&#8221;. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s a question of behaviour and action as we go forward,&#8221; the officials said, adding that the Chinese had "taken on board" Mr. Biden''s comments.\n\n\nIt was, however, made clear that to them that China&#8217;s move was &#8220;part of a longstanding effort&#8221; and unlikely to be withdrawn, and was not a "knee-jerk" decision.\n\n\nChinese officials have stressed that they would not consider withdrawing the move, making the point that several countries had long established such zones. They have specifically pointed out that Japan&#8217;s ADIZ was set up in 1969, and covered the disputed Senkaku or Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea that are disputed by both countries - and now fall within both air defence zones.\n\n\nIn brief remarks to reporters in the middle of their talks on Wednesday, Mr. Xi admitted that &#8220;regional hotspot issues keep cropping up&#8221; and that &#8220;the world as a whole is not tranquil&#8221;. Mr. Biden praised Mr. Xi for being &#8220;candid&#8221; and &#8220;constructive&#8221;, saying that "candour generates trust".\n\n\nChina had announced on November 23 that it would set up an ADIZ in the East China Sea, including the disputed islands and a submerged reef that is under South Korean control. The ADIZ is not a territorial claim, but a pre-defined area beyond a country&#8217;s territorial airspace within which it tracks or monitors aircraft.\n\n\nChina&#8217;s warning that it would take unspecified &#8220;defensive emergency&#8221; measures that may include interception of aircraft that had not notified authorities of their flight plans brought expressions of concern from the U.S., South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. China said last week it has scrambled fighter jets to tail 12 American and Japanese aircraft that had conducted patrols through the ADIZ without notifying China.\n\n\nThe Defence Ministry here on Tuesday released a lengthy statement in an attempt to address regional anxieties, saying the Chinese response would "generally" involve only radar identification, and that deploying fighter jets was "unnecessary" if there was no threat perception.\n\n\nIn Tokyo on Tuesday &#8211; the first stop of his three nation Asia tour &#8211; Mr. Biden spoke of the need for a &#8220;crisis management mechanism&#8221; to reduce tensions. He is expected to raise the idea in Seoul, the last stop of his tour, where he will arrive on Thursday and hold talks with President Park Geun-hye on Friday morning.\n\n\nU.S. officials said Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi had discussed at length the situation in North Korea &#8211; an issue that actually took up more time than the ADIZ.\n\n\n&#8220;I think the credibility of our argument about the impact of pressure on diplomatic solutions has been enhanced in the eyes of a number of countries, including China, by what&#8217;s happened with Iran,&#8221; the senior administration officials said referring to the recent Iran deal.\n\n\n&#8220;That logic, which produced the interim deal in the Iran case, we are laying out as being what should apply in the North Korea case as well," they added, "and we&#8217;ve got a strong argument to make in that respect.&#8221;\n', 'Chinese,international,regional,direct,sudden,significant,other,international,lengthy,cautious,conducive,clear,several,long,such,whole,disputed,submerged,territorial,territorial,unspecified,last,American,Japanese,lengthy,regional,radar,unnecessary,first,last,diplomatic,senior,recent,interim,strong,', ' conducive diplomatic significant strong', ' cautious disputed unnecessary unspecified', 4, -4, 0, 8),

In spite of the language barrier, the Chinese people are very welcoming and friendly.\nSeeing the poverty in China and observing the hard work and ethics that everyone possessed changed my thoughts about China. I understood that everyone worked extremely hard for what they had. My experience in China was life changing. I have developed a perspective on various cultures and communication barriers. I learned a lot about problem solving, and about the freedom we have in India. The Chinese people value <i>Guanxi</i> (relationships). What I found very difficult to adjust to was the organisational bureaucracy which affected even the simplest of requests. Sometimes a simple request would not get a response because the wrong person was addressed, and he/she did not want to lose face by directing you to the right person. \nThe Chinese operate on a very different timetable as compared to Westerners and there is no getting away from that. I would suggest fellow Indians to opt for renowned universities in China as a destination for their higher studies.\nI am eager to come back to India, and to share the knowledge I have gained in China. \n<i>The writer is pursuing her PhD in Environmental Science and Technology at USTB-China.</i>', 'Chinese,same,balanced,good,much,interested,different,hard,perspective,various,difficult,organisational,simple,wrong,different,timetable,fellow,eager,', ' balanced eager good interested simple', ' difficult hard wrong', 5, -3, 2, 8),

The commission, analysts have said, would help Mr. Xi directly assert his authority on security issues &#8212; and, observers noted, raise both the President&#8217;s powers and his profile.\nMr. Xi, in Friday&#8217;s document, described &#8220;State security and social stability&#8221; as &#8220;preconditions for reform and development.&#8221; On the domestic front, the commission will focus on both social stability and addressing security threats &#8212; an issue that has received prominence following last month&#8217;s attack in Tiananmen Square.\nOn the external front, Mr. Xi highlighted maintaining sovereignty as a specific challenge, indicating that the NSC may play a role in managing China&#8217;s many territorial disputes, whether with India on the west, over the South China Sea, or with Japan over the disputed Diaoyu or Senkaku islands in the East China Sea.\n&#8220;With only the Coast Guard given responsibility for the Senkaku islands and the South China Sea, there is a demand within China that the new body should plan for all of these threats,&#8221; said Srikanth Kondapalli, an expert on the Chinese military at Jawaharlal Nehru University.\nHe said the NSC could have &#8220;an impact on the Indian front,&#8221; where recent spats over the disputed border have highlighted, according to some analysts, gaps in the Chinese chain of command. Troops were involved in a three-week stand-off in April in Depsang, in Ladakh, after Chinese soldiers set up a tent in disputed territory.\n&#8220;The Chinese have not explained why Depsang happened,&#8221; Professor Kondapalli said. \n&#8220;That the Chinese themselves have not given an explanation suggests that at their end this issue is highly complicated.&#8221;\nProfessor Kondapalli said the NSC might look to address the &#8220;disjuncture&#8221; between the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA), which is tasked with border defence, and the increasingly influential People&#8217;s Armed Police Force (PAPF) which often deals with terrorism and separatist-related threats.\n&#8220;China has already put up huge outposts with integrated command systems over 20,000 km of its borders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yet the Depsang incident happened, which indicates the need for more centralised decision-making.

The rover, which takes its name from a popular Chinese mythological story about a rabbit that lives on the moon, will spend three months exploring the surface. Media reports said this would mark the first &#8220;soft landing&#8221; on the moon since 1976, when the former Soviet Union achieved the feat. If successful, China&#8217;s space mission will be only the third to do so, with the U.S. also carrying out soft landings in the 1960s. China, a decade ago, joined the U.S. and Russia in another landmark feat by sending its first astronaut into space.\n\n\nWu Zhijian, a spokesperson with the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, told reporters on Tuesday the mission will be &#8220;the most complicated and difficult task in China&#8217;s space exploration&#8221;.\n\n\nThe mission reflects the fast-growing ambitions of China&#8217;s space programme, which earlier this year launched its fifth manned space mission, after also achieving its first docking exercise in space with a laboratory module &#8211; a key step in its plans to launch its own space station by 2020.\n\n\nTaking place close on the heels of the launch of India&#8217;s Mars orbiter, next month&#8217;s lunar mission underlines the rapid strides in both countries&#8217; space programmes.\n\n\nChinese officials have, however, been at pains to downplay suggestions of competition between the two countries. Earlier this month, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei told reporters that both countries had &#8220;expanded mutual cooperation&#8221; when asked about India&#8217;s Mars orbiter launch, although many Chinese media outlets saw India&#8217;s successful launch this month as a challenge to their space programme.\n\n\nThe Global Times, a widely read tabloid, in an editorial about the Mars orbiter wrote that &#8220;in front of an India that is striving to catch up with China, we have no other choice but to construct our comprehensive strategic power.&#8221; On Tuesday, Li Benzheng, the deputy commander-in-chief of the lunar programme, reiterated that there was &#8220;no space race&#8221; with India and that China &#8220;never thought we are in competition&#8221;, State media reported. He also praised India&#8217;s Mars orbiter launch as &#8220;a great accomplishment&#8221;, the New York Times quoted State media as saying.\n\n\nMr. Wu, the administration spokesperson, highlighted the difficulty of next month''s lunar mission, saying that scientists needed to &#8220;ensure a timely launch because of multiple narrow windows of time&#8221;.\n\n\nIndia and the European Space Agency, like China, have carried out lunar missions ending in impact crash landings on the moon&#8217;s surface.\n\n\nIndia&#8217;s Chandrayaan-1, its first unmanned lunar probe, carried out an impact landing after its landmark mission, while the Chandrayaan-2, scheduled to launch in around three years&#8217; time, is slated to attempt the more complex soft landing on the lunar surface.\n\n\nMr. Wu said that after carrying out a soft landing - the first since 1976 - the Jade Rabbit rover will explore areas around the landing spot and send back 3D images and lunar soil analysis. The rover will be carried on the Chang&#8217;e-3 probe. The first Chang&#8217;e probe in 2007 mapped the moon, and crash landed on its surface after a 16 month-long mission.

Key points of the deal: \n\nThis would keep Iran&#8217;s enrichment level well below the threshold needed for weapons-grade material, which is more than 90 percent enrichment. Uranium enriched to 5 per cent is adequate to make fuel for Iran&#8217;s lone energy-producing reactor in Bushehr on the Persian Gulf coast. For Iran, the ability to keep its enrichment program is a critical issue. Iran&#8217;s leaders insist they maintain self-sufficiency over the entire nuclear cycle from mining uranium to making nuclear fuel. \n\n<b>&#8216;NEUTRALISE&#8217; IRAN&#8217;S STOCKPILE OF 20 PER CENT ENRICHED URANIUM </b>\n\n\nThis level of enrichment is within several steps of reaching weapons grade. Eliminating the stockpile eases Western concerns that Iran possibly could move quickly toward a nuclear weapon. Iran can either convert the 20 percent uranium into reactor-ready fuel, which effectively blocks it from further enrichment. Or Iran can dilute the material to levels below 5 percent enrichment. Iranian officials have said the country has a sufficient stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium for long-term operations of its research reactor, which runs at the higher-level uranium and produces isotopes for medical treatments and other uses. Allowing Iran to use the stockpile for domestic purposes is an important political takeaway for Tehran. Iranian leaders had balked at demands to ship the stockpile out of the country. \n\n<b>NO NEW CENTRIFUGES </b>\n\n\nThis effectively freezes Iran&#8217;s enrichment capacities for the next six months. Centrifuges are used to turn concentrated uranium into nuclear fuel. Iran, however, is allowed to keep its two main enrichment facilities in operation. Iran&#8217;s government, which negotiated the deal with world powers in Geneva, would have faced huge backlash from hard-liners at home if either of the labs were forced to shut down. \n\n<b>SUSPEND WORK AT THE ARAK REACTOR </b>\n\n\nThe planned Arak reactor in central Iran is a &#8220;heavy water&#8221; plant, which means it uses a molecular variant of water as a coolant and can run on non-enriched uranium. It also produces a higher degree of plutonium byproduct, which could be extracted and potentially used in weapons production. Iran&#8217;s agreement not to build a plutonium reprocessing facility deals directly with the weapons program concerns. It also could clear the way for future agreements to resume work on the reactor. \n\n<b>IRAN&#8217;S PLEDGE TO ADDRESS U.N. CONCERNS, INCLUDING THE PARCHIN MILITARY SITE </b>\n\n\nThe specific mention of the Parchin military base near Tehran touches on a longstanding impasse between Iran and the U.N.&#8217;s nuclear watchdog organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency. U.N. inspectors want to revisit the site to investigate suspicions of past explosive tests that could have applications in nuclear bomb designs. Iran denies the claim. Iran has said further inspections are possible, but also wanted to impose restrictions that limits on public disclosures by the U.N. agency.

Many countries, from India to the U.S. and Japan, monitor similar zones beyond their immediate territorial airspaces to track aircraft for security purposes.\n\n\nWhile the Chinese government said international flights will not be affected, any other non-commercial flights that have not notified authorities of their flight plans will likely face interception, and could also be brought down.\n\n\nThe People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force said it conducted a first air patrol over the ADIZ shortly after the Saturday morning announcement. The zone extends into international airspace east of China&#8217;s territorial airspace into the East China Sea, and up to 130 km from Japan&#8217;s territorial airspace.\n\n\nThe Chinese ADIZ overlaps with the ADIZ that Japan has already established in the region, with both zones covering the disputed Diaoyu or Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.\n\n\nWhile Chinese officials explained the move as aimed at defending China&#8217;s airspace and boosting early warning systems, the Japanese government said it was &#8220;extremely dangerous as it may lead to miscalculation in the area.&#8221;\n\n\nThe move is likely to fuel tensions with Japan, coming at a time when both countries have sparred over the disputed Senkaku or Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. In recent months, both countries have dispatched patrol boats to enforce their claims, while Japan has also scrambled fighter jets after Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) entered the airspace above the islands and threatened recently to shoot them down.\n\n\nM. Taylor Fravel, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is an expert on China&#8217;s relations with its neighbours, told The Hindu that the rules of engagement that will be established will determine the impact of the move.\n\n\n&#8220;An ADIZ is a air traffic control zone in international airspace, not national airspace,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So, whether it will increase conflict depends on what rules of engagement for intercepting planes that approach the zone without pre-notification. It is probably a response to Japan&#8217;s position that it would shoot down UAVs over the territorial airspace of the Senkakus.&#8221;\n\n\n<b>Japan lodges protest</b>\n\n\nThe Japanese government said in a statement it lodged a &#8220;serious protest,&#8221; with Junichi Ihara, head of the Foreign Ministry&#8217;s Asian and Oceanic Affairs Bureau, conveying the government&#8217;s protest over the telephone with Han Zhiqiang, Minister at the Chinese Embassy in Japan.\n\n\nThe Chinese Defence Ministry spokesperson Yang Yujun defended the move, saying it followed international practices. &#8220;Since the 1950s, over 20 countries, including some big powers and China&#8217;s neighbouring countries, have set up air defence identification zones,&#8221; he told the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\n&#8220;Moreover,&#8221; he added, in an apparent reference to Japan, &#8220;a relevant country established its air defence identification zone as early as 1969, which is also about 130 km from the Chinese mainland at its closest distance.&#8221;\n', 'international,serious,similar,other,territorial,appropriate,international,military,similar,immediate,territorial,international,other,first,international,territorial,East,territorial,disputed,Japanese,dangerous,likely,recent,Chinese,international,national,territorial,Japanese,international,big,air,apparent,early,Chinese,', ' appropriate', ' dangerous disputed serious', 1, -3, -2, 4),

Black smoke rose above gigantic fuel silos and darkened much of the sky. \n\nThe pipeline owned by China&#8217;s largest oil refiner, Sinopec, ruptured and leaked for about 15 minutes onto a street and into the sea before it was shut off. Hours later, as workers cleaned up the spill, the oil caught fire and exploded in two locations, the city government said. \n\nThe <i>Beijing News </i>cited a resident surnamed Gao, who works in logistics, as saying he was driving past Qingdao&#8217;s Huangdao district when he felt the force of the blasts, and then realized the ground in front of him had fractured. The air was pungent, many cars on both sides of the road were overturned and there was dark smoke rising in the distance, he said. \n\n&#8220;It felt like an earthquake, and I was dumbstruck,&#8221; Gao said, adding that there was chaos on the street as people ran, panicking, in all directions. \n\nAuthorities ruled out terrorism but the incident remained under investigation, it said. \n\nPresident Xi Jinping urged local officials to go all out in finding missing people, treating the injured and in finding the cause of the accident, state TV broadcaster CCTV said. \n\nCalls to Sinopec&#8217;s headquarters in Beijing were not immediately answered, but a statement online offered condolences to victims. &#8220;We will investigate the incident with responsibility and give timely reports,&#8221; Sinopec said. \n\nThe Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau said barriers had been set up to contain the oil as it spread into the sea, but that a mixture of gas and oil from a storm sewer exploded and caught fire over the sea. \n\nMore than 3,000 square meters (32,000 square feet) of sea surface was contaminated, the city government said. \n\nAuthorities said the oil had seeped into underground utility pipes, which could have been a factor in the blasts, but they did not elaborate.

Under earlier rules, both parents, in cities, have to be only children to have a second child, while in rural areas families can have a second child if their first born is a girl.\n\n\nXie Chuntao, President of the Journal of the Central Committee&#8217;s elite Party School, said on Friday &#8220;vested interests may pose some difficulties&#8221; to the newly announced reform moves. Officials have said influential SOEs as well as local governments may push back against moves to limit their powers.\n\n\n&#8220;Some interest groups will benefit, some will not,&#8221; Mr. Xie said. &#8220;So this has made reform all the more difficult. For example, those people may not be happy when their vested interests are affected. When government decides to delegate approval power, those people deprived of it may be unhappy when they lose that power. But I believe, this time, vested interests cannot stop the reforms&#8221;.\n\n\nThe Chinese government is hoping the reform moves will help revitalise the slowing economy, push forward the rebalancing of the State investment-driven, export-led economic model, and help boost innovation industries and domestic consumption. The Party said that to do so, it will give the market a &#8220;decisive&#8221; role in allocating resources, and also push forward reform of inefficient and corrupt SOEs.\n\n\nOn political reforms, however, Mr. Xie said the CPC had made clear that it will not dilute its authority. \n\n&#8220;If the system is changed, China will get into chaos,&#8221; Mr. Xie said. &#8220;The CPC will not change the country into a country with multiple parties in power&#8221;.\n\n\nMr. Xie did acknowledge that in the absence of checks and balances on the ruling party, such as an independent judiciary, corruption had proliferated within its ranks. The challenge facing the Party was to improve &#8220;oversight on its power&#8221;, even as it remains wary of relinquishing its political authority.\n\n\nHe suggested that a pilot programme to force newly-promoted officials to declare their assets publicly may help curb corruption. &#8220;This measure will declare the assets held by the official, including houses and bank deposits. If these are declared, it will be very hard for the official to hide their assets,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nAt the same time, the top leadership has, in recent months, waged a campaign to crack down on activists who have been demanding for the party&#8217;s leaders to declare their assets. \n\nMore than a dozen campaigners have been detained.\n\n\nThe latest reform moves have been seen by analysts here as a tightrope walk by the party, as it looks to revitalise the economy even as it consolidates its political power. \n\nLast week&#8217;s plenary meeting also announced the setting up of a first ever National Security Commission to oversee domestic and external security issues &#8211; a move seen as centralising power within the top leadership.\n\n\nMany Chinese analysts have consequently described current President Xi Jinping as the most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping, who launched the &#8220;reform and opening up&#8221; three decades ago. \n\nAsked if he agreed with that description, Mr. Xie said, &#8220;I believe General Secretary Xi is powerful, that is true.

Children&#8217;s films are not for pure entertainment, as they are important for building an open mind,&#8221; Ms. Badr said.\nSannette Naeye, an entertainment professional from the Netherlands, differed, saying that direct contact with the State resulted in control, either overt or felt. In Europe, culture is not in the hands of the State. Rather, the State releases funds to independent bodies, which in turn fund filmmakers.

Last month, Chinese authorities blamed the separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) for organising an attack in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, where a jeep carrying three Uighurs drove into a crowd and burst into flames, killing two tourists. \n\nThe southern Xinjiang prefecture of Kashgar, where Bachu is located, has witnessed intermittent violence, including knife and bomb attacks in 2011 that left more than 20 killed. \n\nLocated in the southern Uighur heartland, the region has also seen growing ethnic tensions between Uighurs and the increasing number of majority Han Chinese migrants. \n\nLocal Uighurs have complained of religious restrictions, including recent campaigns aimed at discouraging locals from wearing veils, growing beards or fasting during the month of Ramadan. Ethnic tensions spilled over into riots in July 2009 in the regional capital, Urumqi, that left at least 197 people killed. \n\nThe Xinjiang government has blamed the incidents on separatist groups, and pledged to crack down on instability and boost security measures in the region.

China&#8217;s family planning restrictions &#8212; widely known as the &#8220;one-child policy,&#8221; though the measures include a complicated system of regulations &#8212; were enforced in the late 1970s, permitting couples in cities to have only one child and those in the countryside to have a second child if their first born was a girl. The rules were last relaxed in 2007, when the government said couples could have a second child if both parents were only children.\n\n\nWhile the government says the policy prevented at least 300 million additional births over the past three decades, critics say the widely unpopular restrictions have infringed upon fundamental human rights. Violators face heavy fines, which most cannot afford, and innumerable violations of the law, such as forced abortions, have been committed on account of the policy, as local officials aimed to meet prescribed targets.\n\n\nFriday&#8217;s document, titled the &#8220;decision on major issues concerning comprehensive and far-reaching reforms,&#8221; followed the November 9-12 meeting of the Central Committee, the 376-member leadership body. \n\nThe four-day session marked the third sitting, or plenum, of the newly selected leadership, which took over in November last year under President Xi Jinping.

Before this week, Medog was the only one of China&#8217;s 2,100 counties to remain isolated from the highway network, according to State broadcaster<i> China Central Television</i> (CCTV). \n\n<b>What the project will do</b>\n\n\nState media reports have focused on the development benefits that the project would bring and have sought to play down the strategic dimensions. Local officials said the road&#8217;s opening will bring down commodity prices and widen access to healthcare. \n\nThe road will also provide access to the border county for nine months of the year. That the government was willing to spend as much as 950 million Yuan &#8211; or $ 155 million &#8211; on a 117-km highway, with ostensibly few economic returns expected, has underscored the project&#8217;s importance to State planners. \n\nLocal officials said prior to the opening of the highway, reaching Medog required traversing the treacherous Galung La and Doxong La mountains at an altitude of 4,000 metres. With frequent landslides, the road was often rendered impassable. \n\nNow, the road will be accessible for &#8220;8 to 9 months per year, barring major natural disasters&#8221;, Ge Yutao, Communist Party head of the transportation department for the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), told Xinhua. \n\nWork on the 117-km road began in 2009, a year after the project was given the green light by the State Council, or Cabinet. \n\n<b>Renewed attention on infrastructure projects</b>\n\n\nThe opening of the road comes at a time when there has been renewed attention on infrastructure projects in border areas in India and China. \n\nLast week, both countries signed a Border Defence Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s visit to Beijing, aimed at expanding confidence-building measures. The agreement calls for setting up channels of communication between military commands, increasing the number of border personnel meetings, and formalising rules such as no tailing of patrols, to built trust and avoid incidents. \n\nThe agreement does not specify or limit either country&#8217;s plans to boost infrastructure &#8211; an issue that, analysts say, has in the past triggered tensions along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC), most notably in April when a Chinese incursion sparked a three-week-long stand-off in Depsang, Ladakh. \n\nHan Hua, a South Asia scholar at Peking University, suggested in a recent interview that the &#8220;basic reason&#8221; for the incident was &#8220;too much construction&#8221; along the border. The Chinese side, she acknowledged, did not have to build closer to the disputed LAC because their infrastructure, as well as more favourable terrain enabled quicker mobilisation. \n\n&#8220;If we don&#8217;t have the overall collaboration of the military, policy-makers and decision-makers on both sides,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it will be difficult to avoid such incidents&#8221;. \n\n<b>&#8216;India&#8217;s plans will not be limited&#8217;</b>\n\n\nThe BDCA, Indian officials said, will not limit India&#8217;s plans to upgrade infrastructure. It recognises the principle of equal and mutual security, which allows either side to pursue its security in its own way. At the same time, officials say the BDCA will still help &#8220;regulate activity&#8221; along the border by opening up new channels of communication, even as the border continues to remain a matter of dispute. \n\nOn Thursday, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesperson Yang Yujun told a regular press conference that military personnel would hold &#8220;regular meetings&#8221; and &#8220;make joint efforts&#8221; to maintain peace in border areas, following the signing of the BDCA.

The charge related to a campaign in which the three activists posed for photographs holding up banners calling for officials to disclose their assets.\n\n\nThe case is being seen by Chinese civil society as a barometer of how the new leadership will deal with calls for reform.\n\n\nWhile the start of Xi Jinping&#8217;s term &#8212; which began in March &#8212; had given some encouragement to those pushing for reform after the new President pledged to crack down on both &#8220;tigers and flies&#8221; in government and reduce graft, in recent months more than a dozen anti-corruption activists have been detained.\n\n\nMs. Liu, an activist from Xinyu, has rejected charges that she violated the law. In 2011, Ms. Liu made an unsuccessful attempt to contest local-level elections in Xinyu, standing as an independent candidate. In China&#8217;s one-party state, direct elections are allowed only at the lowest levels of government in the cities, villages and townships.\n\n\nMs. Liu&#8217;s campaign generated much attention &#8212; particularly on Chinese social media websites, through which she garnered a wide following &#8212; before authorities threatened her and forced her to withdraw her candidacy.\n\n\nIn an interview with The Hindu following her failed campaign, Ms. Liu said she did not have &#8220;grand ambitions&#8221; but only wanted to create awareness. &#8220;Our Constitution says we have a universal right to participate in government. I want us to achieve that right,&#8221; she said.\n\n\nLast year, she was abducted by local officials from Xinyu when she visited Beijing during the Parliament session. \n\nShe was blindfolded, thrown into a car, and illegally imprisoned for two weeks, during which she was beaten, and denied food and water. Ironically, Ms. Liu&#8217;s visit to Beijing had coincided with a move by the National People&#8217;s Congress, or Parliament, to revise the criminal procedure law to ban illegal detentions.\n\n\nMaya Wang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the trial of the three activists had demonstrated the government&#8217;s wariness towards civil society movements.

To this end, the document said the CPC would set up &#8220;a central leading team for comprehensively deepening reform,&#8221; which would be placed in charge of &#8220;coordinating reform&#8221; and &#8220;supervising the implementation of reform plans.&#8221;\n\n\n<b>Slowing economy</b>\n\n\nAt the four-day meeting, which took place amid tight security in a military-run hotel in west Beijing, the 376 members of the CPC&#8217;s Central Committee approved a blueprint for reforms to lay the foundation for growth in the next decade, even as the government grapples with a slowing economy and the challenge to transform the three decades-old, State investment-driven, growth model.\n\n\nThe weekend meeting was the third sitting, or plenum, of the new Central Committee which took over in November of last year, following a once-in-ten-year leadership change. Historically, third plenary meetings have been used to introduce economic reforms, most famously in 1978 when the plenum under the then leader Deng Xiaoping gave the push for China to launch market reforms and close the chapter on Maoism.\n\n\nChina&#8217;s new leaders had, in recent weeks, raised expectations for bold moves by drawing parallels with the 1978 meeting, and declaring that the session would herald &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; reforms.\n\n\n<b>Property rights</b>\n\n\nTwo areas where there had been particular attention were reforming property rights in rural areas to give farmers the right to sell their land, and to reform the influential and wealthy State-owned Enterprises (SOEs).\n\n\nThe communiquÃ© said the property rights protection system &#8220;will be improved,&#8221; and a unified land market for urban and rural areas will be set up, suggesting restrictions on selling farmland may be loosened.\n\n\nWhile China&#8217;s urban property market has boomed since the 1990s after the government opened up the market, the continuing collective ownership of rural land, which can only be leased by farmers, has been seen as slowing down urbanisation and widening the urban-rural income gap. Local governments, which derive most of their revenues from land sales, have opposed giving titles to farmers.\n\n\n&#8220;Farmers currently cannot trade land in the market, so lots of land is lying idle,&#8221; Oliver Meng Rui, Professor of Finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, told <i>The Hindu</i>.\n\n\nHe said there were &#8220;two motivations&#8221; behind land reform. &#8220;One is to let farmers, once they trade land, to get financial benefits. The other is to increase supply of land and cool down the real estate market.&#8221;\n\n\nOn the reform of SOEs, the communiquÃ© only said State-run companies would be made to &#8220;adhere to modern corporate practices&#8221; &#8212; a possible indication, Mr. Rui said, of getting more State-run firms to publicly list on the stock market in the future.\n\n\nIn China, SOEs control monopolies in vital sectors, holding total assets worth $ 7.35 trillion. Reforming SOEs has been seen by many economists here as a key step in the government&#8217;s objective of transforming the State investment-driven model and boosting innovation industries.\n\n\n<b>Murky ties</b>\n\n\nOfficials acknowledge that many State-run enterprises have emerged as hotbeds of corruption, holding murky ties with elite Party families and other interest groups. According to a survey conducted this week by the Party-run Global Times, 30 per cent of respondents viewed &#8220;vested interest groups&#8221; as posing the biggest obstacle to reforms. Another 45.4 per cent blamed local governments for blocking Central policies.\n\n\nBeyond economic reforms, the document highlighted the leadership&#8217;s focus on maintaining social stability, announcing the setting up of a State Security Committee to &#8220;safeguard state security&#8221; and &#8220;effectively prevent and end social disputes&#8221; although it did not detail what specific role the newly set up body would play.\n\n\n<b>Judicial reforms</b>\n\n\nThe document also acknowledged the need for judicial reforms &#8220;to ensure independence and fairness in prosecuting bodies and courts,&#8221; amid growing calls to overhaul the Party-controlled courts system to address rising unrest at the grassroots, often triggered by land disputes involving local governments.\n', 'key,economic,prominent,decisive,prominent,basic,economic,specific,further,effective,central,tight,next,third,new,last,third,plenary,economic,close,new,recent,bold,particular,rural,influential,wealthy,unified,rural,collective,rural,derive,financial,other,real,modern,corporate,possible,vital,total,many,key,many,elite,other,local,economic,social,social,specific,Judicial,judicial,local,', ' basic bold decisive effective elite influential modern prominent real vital wealthy', ' close', 11, -1, 10, 12),

In Guizhou alone, 4,000 km of roads are being constructed. \n\nOutside Dimen, a small village of 520 households, construction workers from nearby Hunan province hurriedly wheeled crates of stones and rocks, as hammering and drilling echoed through the green valleys and rice fields. \n\n&#8220;The new roads will change the village&#8217;s fortune,&#8221; said one Dimen resident hopefully, as he sat in the village square on a recent afternoon. \n\nIn his thirties, the villager &#8211; and his three companions &#8211; had all returned home, after they failed to land permanent jobs in nearby cities, to help their parents tend the rice fields, where farmers practice subsistence agriculture on small plots of land. \n\nBut more than the newly paved road, the future of Dimen &#8211; and that of thousands of similar villages across China &#8211; will likely rest on the outcomes of a meeting taking place this weekend more than 2,000 km away. \n\nOn Saturday, China&#8217;s top leaders &#8211; the 376 members of the Communist Party of China&#8217;s (CPC) Central Committee &#8211; will gather in a west Beijing hotel for a key meeting to push forward far-reaching economic reforms. \n\nThe meeting &#8211; the third sitting, or plenum, of the new Central Committee that came to power in November last year &#8211; has been framed by State media as being as significant as the key third plenum of 1978, which heralded China&#8217;s &#8220;opening up&#8221; and market reforms under Deng Xiaoping. \n\nThe current leader, Xi Jinping, has himself raised expectations by repeatedly invoking Deng in the months since has taken over, most notably during a trip, shortly after assuming power, to Guangdong &#8211; the same southern province from where Deng kick-started reforms. \n\nAmong the policy measures that will be discussed during a four-day, behind-closed-doors, meeting are: allowing farmers, such as those tied to their plots in Dimen, to sell their land for the first time, rather than only lease land under current rules of collective ownership; overhauling social security restrictions that deny rural residents access to social welfare benefits when they move to cities; liberalising interest rates to give households fairer returns on their savings; and considering moves to curtail the influence of State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) to allow greater competition and bring efficiency. \n\nThe first two reforms, economists say, are essential for addressing inequality between cities and the countryside, and between the prosperous coastal east and the western hinterland - inequality which is currently the widest in China&#8217;s history. \n\nThe common pressing challenge underlying all the proposed measures is taking forward the rebalancing of the Chinese economy, away from State investment-led growth, which has driven China&#8217;s growth story over the past three decades, to growth led by domestic demand, consumption and innovation. \n\n\n\nIn the villages of Guizhou, local officials are banking on a state-wide spurt in spending to drive growth, by unleashing construction projects and developing half-a-dozen tier-two cities that officials hope will drive consumption. Zhao Kezhi, the CPC chief of Guizhou, said the province saw &#8220;urbanisation&#8221; as the &#8220;solution to the problem&#8221;, with the government targeting achieving a 50 per cent urbanisation rate by 2020 to address the income inequality problem. To do so, the province is spending billions in building new semi-urban economic zones and expanding 12 tier-two cities to create &#8220;regional hubs&#8221;. \n\n\n\nWhile the government hopes that urbanisation will drive growth, many economists warn that such projects may end up as bridges to nowhere &#8211; and result in worsening an already serious debt problem among local governments &#8211; without accompanying structural reforms. \n\nThe central issue, according to Michael Pettis, an economist at Peking University, is how to transfer wealth from the State sector to households. One proposed measure is liberalising interest rates, which have been kept low by the government to subsidise capital costs of State-run enterprises and manufacturers. Another measure is land reforms that would, for the first time, allow farmers to hold titles and sell their land, which is, at present, held collectively by village committees - a last vestige of China''s Socialist past. \n\nBoth measures have faced opposition from special interest groups: the former from entities such as SOEs that have benefited from access to easy capital; and the latter from local governments who derive most of their revenue from land sales. \n\nCai Hongbin, a senior economist at Peking University, said &#8220;sweeping policy changes&#8221; are unlikely at the plenum. &#8220;The reason is this will take time,&#8221; he said. The leadership under Mr. Xi has been in office for only one year, he pointed out. \n\n\n\nMr. Cai said his hope was that rather than specific &#8220;policy changes&#8221;, the plenum would pave the way for &#8220;government reforms&#8221; to redefine the State&#8217;s relationship with the market, society and local governments: by allowing a greater role for the market in allocating resources, greater space for non-governmental organisations, and closer supervision on often corrupt local governments. \n\nThe challenge for Mr. Xi is that most of these ostensibly economic reform measures face imposing political obstacles, ranging from the sizeable influence still wielded by SOEs, many of which are tied to elite Party families, and the demands of dozens of other special interest groups. \n\n&#8220;The real issue&#8221;, said Mr. Pettis, &#8220;is how to change growth built around a particular type of political structure into one dependent on a very different kind of political structure, and to do that in an orderly way in 5 or 6 years.&#8221; \n\n&#8220;For 30 years, China was growing at 11 per cent, household wealth was growing at 3 per cent, so the State sector was clearly growing higher,&#8221; he said. \n\n&#8220;Rebalancing means household income has to take a bigger share, and the State has to take less. For thirty years, the interests of the elite lined up with the interest of the country. For the next few years," he added, "I worry that these interests are not aligned&#8221;. \n\n', 'lush,impassable,small,new,western,small,nearby,green,new,recent,permanent,nearby,small,similar,top,key,economic,third,new,last,significant,key,third,current,same,such,first,current,collective,social,social,first,essential,prosperous,common,past,domestic,local,new,economic,many,such,serious,local,structural,central,low,first,last,special,former,such,easy,local,derive,senior,specific,local,corrupt,local,economic,political,sizeable,many,other,special,real,particular,political,dependent,different,political,orderly,elite,next,few,', ' easy elite essential lush orderly prosperous real significant special top', ' corrupt low serious', 10, -3, 7, 13),

The newspaper did not mention the reason for the removal of General Peng, who was in November appointed to the CPC&#8217;s 370-member Central Committee, following the leadership change. \n\nTop officials in Xinjiang have, in the past, been removed from their positions after high-profile incidents. In September 2009, the Urumqi Party Secretary, Li Zhi, was sacked following the ethnic riots in July of that year, which left at least 197 people killed. \n\nHis sacking was followed by the unexpected removal in 2010 of the powerful Party chief in Xinjiang, Wang Lequan, who was known for his hard-line policies and directed the region&#8217;s development for more than a decade. His successor, the current Party secretary Zhang Chunxian, has sought to portray a less tough approach by emphasising economic development over security issues, although he has persisted with many of Mr. Wang&#8217;s security policies. \n\nOn Sunday, the CPC Party Chief in Beijing, Guo Jinlong, called on police and security forces to &#8220;look for vulnerable links&#8221; following the October 28 incident, as he conducted a two-day &#8220;inspection tour&#8221; in the capital. \n\nA jeep carrying three Uighurs &#8211; the ethnic Turkic minority native to Xinjiang &#8211; managed to evade the security barriers in place around the famous square as it drove into a crowd at the Tiananmen gate and burst into flames.

The group had acquired funds of 40,000 RMB (Rs. four lakh), as well as Tibetan knives and 400 litres of petrol, used to set the car on fire.\n\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday said the ETIM had &#8220;incited, organised and committed terrorist attacks of various forms over the years and spread the ideas of violence and terrorism&#8221;.\n\n\n&#8220;It has been the most direct and real threat to our security, and has damaged the security of other countries and regions,&#8221; spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters.\n\n\nExperts have, however, been divided on the actual reach &#8212; and capabilities &#8212; of the ETIM. \n\nMs. Hua said the group was &#8220;based in South, Central and West Asia&#8221; and had &#8220;connections with many other terrorist groups&#8221;.\n\n\nPan Zhiping, an expert on terrorism issues at Xinjiang University, told The Hindu in an interview that he was of the opinion that the attack bore the signature of the ETIM and was &#8220;definitely an organised activity&#8221;.\n\n\n&#8220;It is a new challenge for China, and China will make every effort to break the terrorists&#8217; momentum,&#8221; said Mr. Pan, a long-time resident of Xinjiang. &#8220;We might need some emergency plans,&#8221; he added.\n\n\nOfficials in Xinjiang have, in the past, blamed the ETIM&#8217;s overseas members, chiefly those active in reported camps in Pakistan, for fomenting attacks in Hotan, the city from where eight of those alleged to have been involved in Monday&#8217;s attack hailed.\n\n\nThe issue has become an irritant in China&#8217;s otherwise &#8220;all-weather&#8221; relationship with Pakistan, with Chinese officials privately bemoaning Pakistan&#8217;s inability to crack down on terror groups even as Beijing goes ahead with deepening strategic ties in other areas.\n\n\nMr. Pan said it was, as yet, unclear whether overseas members were involved in Monday&#8217;s incident. \n\n&#8220;The Pakistan government is very nice to the Chinese government, but some people from ETIM are hiding in Pakistan and Afghanistan,&#8221; he said. \n\n&#8220;It is possible that those in exile in Pakistan are directing this terrorist act.&#8221; (Sisi Tang contributed to reporting.)\n\n\nExperts have, however, been divided on the actual reach &#8212; and capabilities &#8212; of the ETIM.

(576, '281', 'October 31, 2013', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-tale-of-two-handshakes/article5297752.ece', '\nWittingly or unwittingly, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh gave two different meanings to handshakes when he visited Moscow and Beijing last week. At the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Dr. Singh said on October 21: &#8220;Every handshake reveals the warmth of the ties between our two people. Together, they create an unmatched platform for the future.&#8221; Two days later, in Beijing, the Prime Minister said after talks with Premier Li Keqiang: &#8220;We account for 2.5 billion people. When India and China shake hands, the world takes notice.&#8221;\n\n\nThe first handshake referred to the comfort of a strategic relationship that had defined India&#8217;s diplomacy over the years; the second placed India and China in the domain of &#8220;re-emerged&#8221; nations, whose import the world is still contending with.\n\n\nAt a time when considerable time and energy are being expended in pushing China and India to take the stage as rivals, the repeated contacts between the two countries take some of the sting out of this narrative. With the United States keen on curbing Chinese influence, India is seen as the obvious counter-weight to China, a prospect Delhi has rejected time and again in public. In nuanced references, Dr. Singh made it plain last week that the India-Russia handshake was time-tested; the one with China was new and continued to attract global attention given the economic strength of the two Asian nations.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister&#8217;s two terms at the helm will be known for a strategic embrace of the U.S. and its policies, but his praise for Russia and what it had done for India was generous and full-throated. &#8220;India has benefited enormously from Russian support in every aspect of India&#8217;s national development efforts &#8212; be it the development of heavy industry, the power sector, our space programme or... our defence needs... Russia has stood by India at moments of great international challenge, when our own resources were limited and our friends were few... it is this last fact that Indians will never forget,&#8221; Dr. Singh said.\n\n\n<b>Special and privileged</b>\n\n\nReferring to the relationship with Russia as special and privileged, the Prime Minister was generous in his praise for Moscow. &#8220;Russia offered us partnership in nuclear energy when the world still shunned nuclear commerce with us. I take particular joy in informing this august audience that the first unit of the Kudankulam nuclear power plant, built with Russian assistance, went critical in July this year and that the second one should be commissioned early next year. The Indian oil company ONGC&#8217;s largest overseas presence is in Russia,&#8221; he stressed.\n\n\nBeyond the comfort zone of Russia, the Prime Minister, who flew to Beijing from Moscow, reflected a new confidence when it came to raising difficult issues in public with China. Given that this was his third meeting in 2013 with the top Chinese leadership, his comments should silence some of his harsh, hawkish critics at home.\n\n\nAfter listing a host of common concerns and the need for a joint approach, Dr. Singh possibly became the first Indian leader to put his concerns to the Chinese publicly on Chinese soil. Usually, these concerns are placed off-the-record to accompanying Indian mediapersons.\n\n\n&#8220;Naturally, there are also concerns on both sides &#8212; whether it is incidents in the border region, trans-border rivers or trade imbalances. Our recent experiences have shown that these issues can become impediments to the full exploitation of the opportunities for bilateral and multilateral cooperation between India and China...,&#8221; he said at the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s central party school.\n\n\nSo, recent tensions on the India-China boundary, concerns about Chinese activity on the Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra river system, as well as issues of trade imbalance figured in these full-spectrum remarks.\n\n\n<b>Beyond bilateralism</b>\n\n\nGoing beyond the pure bilateral domain, Dr. Singh spoke about the need to put in place a rule-based security architecture which, he hoped, would promote security and stability in the larger Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\n&#8220;Above all, India and China need a stable, secure and prosperous Asia-Pacific region. The centre of gravity of global opportunities and challenges is shifting to this region. In the coming decades, China and India, together with the United States, Japan, Korea and the ASEAN community, will be among the largest economies in the world.&#8221;\n\n\nIn an obvious reference to China&#8217;s many unresolved maritime disputes with its neighbours, Dr. Singh said: &#8220;While this region embodies unparalleled dynamism and hope, it is also one with unsettled questions and unresolved disputes. It will be in our mutual interest to work for a cooperative, inclusive and rule-based security architecture that enhances our collective security and regional and global stability.&#8221;\n\n\nA job politely but directly done. There was no anger here, just an expression of concern. Given India&#8217;s and China&#8217;s high stakes in peace and stability, raising concerns before a key audience in China is surely something that Indians concerned about China should appreciate.\n\n\nSetting out a larger strategic direction for bilateral relations, Dr. Singh said: &#8220;More than ever before, the world needs both countries to prosper together. We were not destined to be rivals, and we should show determination to become partners. Our future should be defined by cooperation and not by confrontation. It will not be easy, but we must spare no effort.&#8221;\n\n\nAfter visits to the U.S., Russia and China, the Prime Minister&#8217;s high noon of foreign policy is, clearly, coming to a close. The intent of his remarks in Russia and China could well indicate his desire to spell out his legacy, and a direction for the future. While he fanned the warmth and strength of India&#8217;s relationship with Russia, Dr. Singh also conveyed a solid message that our ties with China can continue to grow if impediments are dealt with speedily. A clearer message to China and its leadership could not have been conveyed.\n\n\nAs India hurtles to a fractious and noisy election, Dr. Singh&#8217;s China visit has passed without cries of a &#8220;sell-out&#8221; from the principal opposition, whose interest in global politics and bilateral relations appears to be both selective and limited. At a time when Russian and Indian leaders meet annually in Moscow or New Delhi, and there are repeated bilateral interactions with the Chinese, there is need to move beyond immediate outcomes in the form of agreements in assessing the quality of bilateral relationships.\n\n\n<b>Not a dampener</b>\n\n\nAlthough hopes of a possible deal on Kudankulam getting two additional Russian nuclear reactors were raised before Dr. Singh left for Moscow, in the end these did not materialise. Given the complex and tortuous nature of concerns surrounding any new deal, the lack of agreement hardly comes as a surprise. In a situation where both Russia and India remain engaged in dialogue, the inability to reach an agreement should not come as a dampener.\n\n\nThe media, perhaps, need to shed its obsession with the &#8220;immediate&#8221; in India&#8217;s dealings with key nations and instead look at the long-term trajectory of relations with these countries. Engagement, it seems, is going to be a continuous process. Days after Dr. Singh concluded his visit to Russia and China, there will be a dialogue of Russia-India-China Foreign Ministers on the sidelines of the Asem (Asia-Europe Meeting) Foreign Ministers&#8217; meeting in New Delhi on November 10-11, another sign of consistent engagement.\n\n\nThat is the nature of modern-day diplomacy. It&#8217;s never-ending.\n\n\nTo my mind, the tone and tenor of Dr. Singh&#8217;s comments in Moscow and China should act as a guiding principle for his successor.\n\n\n<i>(Amit Baruah is an independent, Delhi-based journalist, who has worked with </i>The Hindu<i>, </i>Hindustan Times<i> and </i>BBC<i>.

Among the 38 injured were three tourists from the Philippines, including two women, and a man from Japan. \n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Public Security, or police authority, said its officials were investigating the incident. Police officials said the jeep &#8220;burst into flames&#8221; after crashing into a guard rail of the Jinshui bridge that lies across the moat that surrounds the Forbidden City. While it remained unclear if the crash was an accident or a deliberate act, the incident sparked wide discussion on Chinese social media websites.\n\n\nMost microbloggers speculated that the crash may have been an intended attack, considering that Tiananmen Square is one of the most politically sensitive places in the Chinese capital, located next to Zhongnanhai &#8212; the central leadership compound &#8212; and the Great Hall of the People.\n\n\nThe square has witnessed many protests in the past, most notably in 1989, when the government crushed student protests.

The Prime Minister stressed that &#8220;we should do nothing to disturb that&#8221; and &#8220;at the same time should move quickly to resolve our boundary issue&#8221;.\n\n\nEnsuring peace along the border and increasing consultations &#8220;on complex issues such as trans-border rivers and our trade imbalance&#8221; were two of the seven principles of engagement Dr. Singh outlined.\n\n\nHis speech struck a noticeably more measured &#8211; and realistic &#8211; tone about the future of the relationship than evident in past &#8220;shared vision&#8221; statements by leaders, which have often downplayed &#8211; or even ignored &#8211; more difficult issues while setting lofty objectives.\n\n\nThe idea was to impress upon Thursday&#8217;s select audience, which included rising provincial Party secretaries, promising CPC cadres and diplomats-in-waiting &#8211; China&#8217;s &#8220;future leaders&#8221;, as one school official put it &#8211; the often divergent and complex forces shaping the bilateral relationship, which has seen rapid economic growth even as strategic mistrust has persisted.\n\n\n&#8220;Concerns on both sides &#8211; whether it is incidents in the border region, trans-border rivers or trade imbalances&#8230;. can become impediments to the full exploitation of the opportunities for bilateral and multilateral cooperation between India and China,&#8221; Dr. Singh said.\n\n\nFraming peace on the border as the &#8220;cornerstone&#8221; of the relationship is a message that the Prime Minister has emphasised to the Chinese leadership particularly in the aftermath of the face-off along the border in April, in Depsang in Ladakh, triggered by Chinese troops putting up tents in disputed areas.\n\n\nTrans-boundary rivers and the widening trade imbalance were also mentioned as &#8220;complex issues&#8221; that required greater consultations.\n\n\nThe other five areas of engagement were: sensitivity to each other&#8217;s core concerns; greater policy coordination on global issues to boost strategic trust; pushing economic ties; widening people-to-people contact; and &#8220;a spirit of transparency&#8221; to eliminate misunderstandings on issues concerning &#8220;our region and our periphery&#8221;.\n\n\nThe last point appeared to reference India&#8217;s concerns on a number of aspects of China&#8217;s engagement with Pakistan. During Wednesday&#8217;s talks, India reiterated its concerns over Chinese investments in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\n\nIn Thursday&#8217;s speech, Dr. Singh also highlighted the threat of &#8220;terrorism, extremism and radicalism emanating from our neighbourhood&#8221;, saying it was affecting &#8220;both of us directly and can create instability across Asia.&#8221;\n\n\nThe Prime Minister described maritime security in the Pacific and Indian Oceans as essential to India&#8217;s energy security, and said it was in India&#8217;s interest to see an &#8220;inclusive and rule-based security architecture&#8221; in Asia. He also emphasised that India&#8217;s strategic partnerships with other countries were &#8220;defined by our own economic interests, needs and aspirations&#8221; and &#8220;not directed against China or anyone else&#8221;. Chinese State media have frequently denounced India''s recent moves to bolster its economic ties in Southeast Asia, particularly with countries like Vietnam that are embroiled in disputes with China over the South China Sea.\n\n\n&#8220;We expect a similar approach from China,&#8221; Dr. Singh said. &#8220;We were not destined to be rivals, and we should show determination to become partners&#8221;.\n\n\nDr. Singh was earlier introduced to the Party School&#8217;s students in glowing terms, described by Wang Yi, the Chinese Foreign Minister, as a &#8220;world-renowned statesman&#8221;.\n\n\nHe Yiting, the Party&#8217;s School Executive Vice-President, introduced Dr. Singh as the architect of India&#8217;s economic reforms. &#8220;The success of India can be attributed to the hard work of Dr. Singh,&#8221; he said.\n\n\nFollowing the address, Dr. Singh was asked by the mayor of a city in southern Hunan province about how both sides could widen economic cooperation. He suggested infrastructure investments as one avenue, considering Chinese capabilities and Indian needs.\n\n\nAn official from the Foreign Affairs Office of Hainan, a southern island province, asked Dr. Singh what he saw as the biggest challenge facing the relationship.\n\n\n&#8220;The most important thing for both of us to undertake,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;is to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border&#8221;.\n', 'new,practical,such,boundary,other,elite,future,same,boundary,such,realistic,past,difficult,provincial,divergent,complex,bilateral,rapid,economic,strategic,full,bilateral,multilateral,Chinese,disputed,other,global,strategic,economic,last,Chinese,essential,strategic,other,own,economic,recent,economic,similar,economic,hard,economic,Chinese,important,', ' elite essential important practical realistic', ' complex difficult disputed divergent hard', 5, -5, 0, 10),

For the northern city of Harbin, the city&#8217;s heating systems kicked in Sunday, and on Monday visibility there was less than 50 meters, according to state media. \nPrimary and middle schools and some highways were closed, said authorities in the city, which is in China&#8217;s northernmost province bordering Russia. At least 40 flights flying to destinations in southern China and Beijing among others had been cancelled or postponed at Harbin&#8217;s Taiping International Airport on Monday morning.\nSome of the city&#8217;s buses also stopped running, the official Xinhua News Agency said. \nThe density of fine particulate matter used as an indicator of air quality was more than 24 times higher in Harbin than the level considered safe by the World Health Organization. The PM2.5 density was above 617 micrograms per cubic meter, according to official readings. A safe level recommended by WHO is 25 micrograms per cubic meter. \nAustin&#8217;s management team said the 63-year-old singer had been treated in hospital on Friday morning for the asthma attack in combination with respiratory infection. She returned to her hotel later Friday to rest, but she was unable to physically perform at her concert scheduled for Beijing on Friday evening. Her Saturday night concert in Shanghai went ahead. \nOn the morning ahead of her concert Friday, Beijing&#8217;s air was visibly polluted, with the city&#8217;s environmental monitoring centre warning children, the elderly and those with respiratory illnesses to reduce outdoor activity. \nChina&#8217;s major cities have some of the world&#8217;s worst smog. The government was long indifferent to the environment as it pursued economic development, but has begun launching some anti-pollution initiatives after mounting public frustration. \nLast month, China&#8217;s Cabinet released an action plan that aims to make a small reduction in the country&#8217;s heavy reliance on coal to below 65 percent of total energy usage by 2017.

It suggested that an Afghan, Pakistani and Chinese consortium be established to undertake this activity. It was a serious and thought out proposal for it was made by a very senior Pakistani Minister. The Afghans were not certain if Pakistan had taken China on board before making the sounding but some in Kabul saw this as a manifestation of a Sino-Pakistan nexus on Afghanistan. The Afghans rejected the Pakistani idea altogether.\n\n\nThis episode holds a lesson for the Indian strategic community which is focussed on U.S. and Pakistan&#8217;s role in Afghanistan. This is unexceptionable but our security establishment should also pay close attention to China&#8217;s policies, both direct and along with Pakistan, towards Afghanistan as they may intersect Indian approaches and interests. A middle official level dialogue between India and China on Afghanistan has occurred but far greater scrutiny of Chinese actions is needed.\n\n\nChina has always looked at Afghanistan with caution and circumspection but never with indifference; it has actively but <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/xi-signals-greater-role-for-china-in-afghanistan/article5180096.ece" target="_blank">quietly pursued its interests</a> in a country with which it shares a short boundary in the high mountains at the eastern edge of the Wakhan Corridor. On the Chinese approach in the 1960s, the American scholar Dupree notes, &#8220;the Chinese moved from behind the bamboo curtain to woo the Afghans socially, politically, and, in a lesser degree, economically.&#8221; During the Afghan Jehad against the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, the Chinese supported the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan" target="_blank">Afghan Mujahideen</a>. Barnett Rubin, an authority on the Afghan Jehad, writes, &#8220;the operation was not just a CIA operation; it was a joint operation of the CIA, the ISI, the Al Istakhbarat al-Ama (General Directorate) of Saudi Arabia. The Chinese were also involved (although they were and are rather discreet about this). These were four intelligence agencies that met every week in Islamabad. A lot of weapons from China went into Afghanistan as well but were not paid for by the Chinese.&#8221;\n\n\nIronically, the success of the Afghan Jehad invigorated China&#8217;s main internal security threat &#8212; Xinjiang&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/china-jails-11-for-extremist-crimes-in-xinjiang-violence/article4832813.ece" target="_blank">Uighur militancy</a> and quest for throwing off the Chinese yoke. In the 1990s, as the Taliban gained strength and territory in Afghanistan and as their alliance with the al-Qaeda deepened they began to give sanctuary and support to Central Asian Islamic militant groups and others including the Uighur groups. It is generally believed that a thousand Uighur militants came to Afghanistan but in 2003 a senior Chinese official gave this writer a much higher figure.\n\n\n<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-could-also-mount-pressure-on-pakistan-to-abandon-militancy-says-us-think-tank/article481495.ece" target="_blank">China turned to Pakistan</a> to persuade the Taliban to expel the Uighur militants from Afghanistan. The &#8220;all weather friend&#8221; interceded; Chinese officials met senior Taliban leaders who made promises to rein in the Uighur militants. The promises were not kept. Following 9/11, the Taliban were ousted by the Coalition and Northern Alliance forces in November 2001. They retreated into Pakistan and the Uighur militants went with them.\n\n\nChina went along with international efforts on Afghanistan after 9/11 but remained restrained in its public articulation on the Taliban and low key in Kabul after the establishment of the Hamid Karzai led Interim Administration. On his part, Mr. Karzai began to assiduously woo China, a courtship he has continued throughout his presidency. He visited Beijing in January 2002, ahead of his visit to India which came in end February of that year. Since then he has visited China on numerous occasions, including for four state visits; the last was a few weeks ago in September. Through these years bilateral ties have been upgraded: from &#8220;good neighbourly&#8221; to &#8220;comprehensive cooperation&#8221; to &#8220;establishing strategic and cooperative partnership.&#8221; Economic relations have been strengthened with the award of major projects in the mining and hydrocarbons sectors. Contacts in the security and intelligence sectors have intensified. A section of the Kabul elite is strongly supporting the Chinese connection and some have developed economic stakes in it. However, China&#8217;s relations with Pakistan, Pakistan&#8217;s connections with the Taliban and continuing Taliban sympathy for the Uighur cause complicate the relationship.\n\n\nOver the past six years, Afghanistan has provided China with evidence of Pakistan&#8217;s actions to destabilise Afghanistan. Predictably the Chinese have simply ignored all the material given to them. In these interactions China&#8217;s focus has remained on the Uighur militants. Uighur militancy in Xinjiang has been vigorous and bloody over the past decade. China views Afghanistan, according to Chinese scholar Zhao Huasheng, &#8220;as an inescapable part of Xinjiang&#8217;s security.&#8221;\n\n\nChina&#8217;s current approach towards containing Uighur militancy is two-pronged:\n\n\nThe effort with the Taliban to expel the Uighur militants from FATA continues. With this aim the Chinese have not criticised the Taliban on any count. Instead they have said that they are a durable political group and hence have followed the Pakistan line and supported a process of reconciliation between them and the Afghan government. The Taliban June statement assuring that they would not allow Afghan territory to be used against any country would have given satisfaction to China as it did to the U.S. in the context of the al-Qaeda.\n\n\nSecondly, China has focussed on the development of Xinjiang as an industrial base and as a pole in the trade and transit networks it is putting in place in Central Asia and beyond. The Central Asian states have been co-opted in this grand design. Russia has not opposed it either. The prospects of economic benefits and an absence of ideological affinity have denied Uighur militancy sympathy in Central Asian countries except within Islamist groups in the region.\n\n\nThe ambitious <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/lis-pak-visit-to-deepen-allweather-ties/article4736716.ece" target="_blank">Gwadar-Kashgar Trade</a> and Transit Corridor Project which China and Pakistan will undertake has also to be seen in this context. The project which involves the development of the Gwadar port and which will no doubt eventually seek to enmesh Afghanistan has obvious geo-strategic implications for India as it goes ahead with Iran to develop the Chabahar port and its links with and through Afghanistan to Central Asia and beyond.\n\n\nChina is conscious of an inevitable element of competition between the two transit systems. Hence, it is paying close attention to the Chabahar port and developments in western Afghanistan, especially around the Indian-built Zarang-Dilaram Highway that connects the Chabahar port with the strategic Kabul-Kandahar-Herat Road.\n\n\nThe Aynak Copper mines will be developed by China at a cost of over $4 billion. The project envisages the construction of a railway to evacuate copper to Xinjiang via Tajikistan. It is currently stalled because of security concerns but it will eventually be built and will be a model for other mining projects that will be undertaken by China. All this will be designed to integrate a major part of the Afghan mining activity with the economy of Western China.\n\n\nChina takes a long-term view of its interests but pursues them relentlessly. It will do so in Afghanistan too. India has built a fund of goodwill in Afghanistan through the example it holds as a democracy as well as its popular assistance programme. With these assets it is well placed though it will have to navigate the next few years through the minefield of the consequences of the U.S. forces drawdown. In the long term, India will need to evolve new strategies to safeguard and advance its interests in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, it has to make a success of the Hajigak iron ore project and ensure that transport systems are established to move the product through Chabahar.\n\n\n<i>(The writer is a former ambassador to Afghanistan)</i>\n', 'few,extraordinary,mineral,Chinese,serious,senior,certain,unexceptionable,close,direct,Indian,Chinese,short,high,joint,discreet,internal,sanctuary,senior,Chinese,Chinese,senior,international,public,low,key,numerous,last,few,bilateral,cooperative,major,economic,past,vigorous,past,Chinese,inescapable,current,durable,political,industrial,economic,ideological,ambitious,obvious,conscious,inevitable,western,strategic,other,major,Western,popular,next,few,long,new,former,', ' ambitious cooperative discreet durable extraordinary popular sanctuary vigorous', ' close inescapable inevitable low serious', 8, -5, 3, 13),

The energetic Chinese foreign policy &#8212; which has seen Xi hop across a dozen nations in three of the world&#8217;s six continents this year, including an intriguing trip to the Caribbean &#8212; contrasts with the seeming American lassitude all around.\nThis is most evident in Asia, where the self-declared American pivot to the region &#8212; already diluted by being renamed a &#8220;rebalance&#8221; has become hostage to a virtual civil war between the Republican and the Democratic parties. In the meantime, China has moved to shore up relations with strategic neighbours Russia and Central Asia and now to repair ties in South-East Asia that have been frayed by its muscular assertion of territorial claims in the South China Sea.\nXi undertook a whirlwind tour of South-East Asia beginning with a two-day visit to Indonesia earlier this month, followed by a visit to Malaysia and culminating in his participation at the 21st informal leaders meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation at Bali. To underscore the Chinese determination in wooing the ASEAN bloc, this visit has been followed by Premier Li Keqiang&#8217;s October 9-15 tour which saw him first in Brunei to attend the 16th China-ASEAN leaders meeting, the 16th ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, South Korea) summit and the eighth East Asia summit, and then in Thailand and Vietnam.\nThere is more than an element of irony in the fact that at the same time President Obama was compelled to cancel his four-nation, weeklong trip to the region on account of the political crisis in the U.S. He had planned to visit Malaysia and the Philippines, as well as attend the APEC meeting in Bali, followed by the Brunei East Asia summit. It is not clear when Mr. Obama will finally find time to visit the region which has a key role in America&#8217;s Asian &#8220;rebalance.&#8221; As for Central Asia, the Americans seem to have disengaged entirely; even in Afghanistan, there is continuing and discomfiting talk of the &#8220;zero option&#8221; or the total pullout in 2014.\nIt is difficult to avoid the sense that the U.S. is being overwhelmed by the double whammy of domestic political and economic crises, accompanied by external developments. America may be the world&#8217;s sole superpower, but that also means bearing a disproportionate share of the world&#8217;s headaches be it in Syria, Yemen, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea and island disputes of China. The domestic political crisis is more insidious because it could be signalling a desire of the deep establishment to retrench foreign commitments on a longer term basis. The U.S. has a huge domestic agenda, both political and economic, and there is little indication that it is anywhere near evolving ways to deal with them. With some variations, the same could be said of Europe and Japan.\nThe U.S. is deeply aware of the geopolitical challenge that China poses. The articulation of the Asian pivot was one manifestation of this. Another was the call to press new trade arrangements through the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership which would bypass the blockade on the Doha round of the WTO and provide a fresh economic impetus to the western world.\nWashington got off the blocks first in 2009-2010 by challenging Beijing over its handling of its maritime disputes in the South China Sea with a clutch of ASEAN nations and with Japan in the East China Sea. In 2010, China reportedly conveyed to the U.S. that the South China Sea now constituted a &#8220;core interest,&#8221; implying that it was non-negotiable. At the ASEAN Regional Forum meet in Hanoi, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton riposted that &#8220;the United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia&#8217;s maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea,&#8221; and called for a multilateral mechanism to resolve the disputes arising from China&#8217;s outlandish claims in the South China Sea in relation to the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. The American stand was welcomed by the ASEAN states that were locked in the seemingly hopeless struggle against China. This, in turn, encouraged the U.S. to capitalise on the sentiment and declare its pivot to Asia.\nIn all this, the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute between Japan and China occupies a special space because the situation there remains fraught and little has been done to address the issues. However, it has led to a strengthening of the U.S. military alliance with Japan and, in that sense, reinforces the logic of the &#8220;rebalance.&#8221;\nThe Chinese have backtracked on their &#8220;core interest&#8221; assertion and have now nuanced their stand. At one level, they have taken a number of administrative measures to cement their claims. First, has been the creation of a new Sansha city, an administrative body with its headquarters in the Paracel islands. Second, special powers have been given to the border police in Hainan to board vessels and regulate shipping in what China says are its territorial waters. Third, has been a consolidation of the entire maritime domain by the creation of a State Oceanic Administration.\nIn 2002, China and ASEAN had signed a Declaration of Conduct through which they had agreed to &#8220;resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations and negotiations.&#8221; \nBut China has shown little haste in developing this into a practical code of conduct.\nBeijing has consistently refused to discuss the disputes in any but a bilateral forum and its adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Agreement, or the law of the sea, is fitful at best. It has walked away from a Philippines effort to use the UNCLOS mechanism to resolve the dispute. But it is invoking UNCLOS in its dispute with Japan.\nBut there is an important straw in the wind signalling a new tone in Chinese policy. This was contained in Xi Jinping&#8217;s speech at a special study session of the party&#8217;s politburo on China&#8217;s maritime issues at the end of July where he reiterated an old formulation of Deng Xiaoping, termed the 12 character guideline, which essentially noted that in the island disputes, &#8220;sovereignty remains ours,&#8221; but China was ready to &#8220;shelve disputes and pursue joint development.&#8221; This was underscored by Foreign Minister Wang Yi who, during the course of a South-East Asian tour in early August noted that the eventual resolution of disputes could only be reached through bilateral talks and would &#8220;take time,&#8221; and in the meantime, there was need to pursue the Code of Conduct for handling problems peacefully.\nThe Xi-Li tours to South-East Asia, therefore, appear to be part of a larger strategy where China, having drawn its lines on the sand in the South China Sea, is now seeking to moderate its fallout. In the larger geopolitical framework it would appear that Beijing is working with the assumption that it has a window of some three or four years in which it will take the U.S. and Europe to hack their way out of the self-created maze they are in. \nThis is the period in which Beijing needs to reach out and consolidate new relationships and configure partnerships that will help China assume its rightful place as a world power of consequence.\nIn the 19th century, Britain initiated the Great Game to limit Russian power. The Great Game today is about the rise of China, and the U.S. effort in remaining number one, come what may. The 21st century game is not about containment, which is simply not possible when each is the other&#8217;s second largest trading partner. It is about competition to be the number one economic and military power in the world and, in that sense, it is about winning and losing and its consequences thereof.\n<i>(Manoj Joshi is a distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi.)</i>', 'separate,Chinese,geopolitical,energetic,Chinese,foreign,evident,virtual,Democratic,strategic,muscular,territorial,informal,16th,16th,same,weeklong,political,clear,key,total,difficult,double,domestic,political,economic,external,disproportionate,domestic,political,insidious,foreign,huge,domestic,political,economic,little,same,aware,geopolitical,Asian,new,fresh,economic,national,open,international,multilateral,struggle,special,fraught,little,military,administrative,new,administrative,special,territorial,entire,territorial,jurisdictional,peaceful,friendly,little,practical,bilateral,fitful,important,new,special,old,ready,Asian,early,eventual,bilateral,geopolitical,new,rightful,19th,Russian,possible,second,economic,military,distinguished,', ' democratic distinguished energetic fresh friendly important open peaceful practical ready rightful special', ' difficult disproportionate fraught insidious little struggle', 12, -6, 6, 18),

In doing so, Mr. Xi (59), the &#8220;princeling&#8221; son of a former leading CPC official, has also established a style markedly different from that of his more subdued predecessor Hu Jintao. \n\nThe Hebei &#8220;self-criticism&#8221; session, most strikingly, did not involve lower-level cadres but the senior most officials, including the Governor, of the northern Chinese province. \n\nThe officials&#8217; comments touched upon topics that often emerge as the subject of Chinese citizens&#8217; ire, such as extravagant banquets, luxury government cars and elaborate &#8220;inspection tours&#8221; that are often meaningless charades. \n\n&#8220;We began just glancing at &#8216;shop fronts&#8217; and rarely checking out &#8216;the backyards&#8217; and &#8216;corners&#8217; during inspection trips,&#8221; confessed one official, as the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported. \n\nSaid another: &#8220;After we were promoted and were officials for a long time &#8230; we started feeling good and arrogant&#8230; surrounded by praise and constantly pleased by others&#8221;. \n\nThe Hebei session, CPC officials say, may be just the beginning.

(591, '281', 'October 26, 2013', 'http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/higher-court-affirms-bos-life-sentence/article5271294.ece', '\nA higher-level provincial court on Friday upheld the life imprisonment sentence awarded in September to the former Politburo member Bo Xilai, rejecting the once powerful politician&#8217;s appeal against charges of corruption and abuse of power. \n\nThe Shandong High People&#8217;s Court on Friday morning said it "affirmed the original sentence of life imprisonment", Xinhua reported. \n\nMr. Bo was sentenced by the Jinan Intermediate People&#8217;s Court &#8211; a lower-level court in Shandong province &#8211; after being found guilty of accepting more than 20 million Yuan (Rs. 20 crore) in bribes and helping cover up the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, who had been poisoned by Mr. Bo&#8217;s wife, Gu Kailai. \n\nAt the trial, Mr. Bo mounted an unexpected and strong defence, accusing Communist Party of China (CPC) investigators of coercing a confession and alleging that he had been denied a fair hearing. \n\nMr. Bo&#8217;s appeal, however, had little chance of succeeding. In China, the courts are under the control of the CPC. High-profile political trials are carefully choreographed affairs, with outcomes determined in advance by internal Party deliberations. \n\nMr. Bo&#8217;s sentence is the highest awarded to a Politburo member in decades. The last two high-ranking leaders who were sentenced were the Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Liangyu &#8211; given 18 years in prison in \n\n2008 for embezzlement and abuse of power &#8211; and former Beijing Party boss Chen Xitong, who was given a 16-year jail term in 1998 for corruption. \n\nWhile both those cases were also seen in China as triggered by factional in-fighting, Mr. Bo&#8217;s especially attracted wide attention because of his special status as a Party &#8220;princeling&#8221;. Mr. Bo&#8217;s father, Bo Yibo, was a well-known and powerful CPC revolutionary leader and associate of Mao Zedong. \n\nThe younger Bo rose quickly through Party ranks, seen as crucial member of the &#8220;second Red generation&#8221; of CPC leaders who were taking control of the party. The current President and General Secretary Xi Jinping is another Red princeling &#8211; his father Xi Zhongxun was a contemporary of Bo Yibo&#8217;s. \n\nMr. Bo also emerged as a key player in renewed ideological debates that were surfacing within the CPC ahead of its once-in-ten-year leadership change last year. During his time as the Party boss in Chongqing, he emerged as a poster-boy of the Left through his social welfare focused &#8220;Chongqing model&#8221;, which won him wide popularity in the municipality through expanding low-income housing projects and easing restrictions that limit welfare benefits for migrant workers. \n\nAt the same time, Mr. Bo&#8217;s authoritarian rule divided opinion. He launched a nationally-famous corruption crackdown that broke up the notorious Chongqing mafia. But the hard-line approach of his former police chief and right-hand man, Wang Lijun, generated alarm, as lawyers were locked up and businessmen saw their assets seized by the State with little recourse to remedy. The Bo family also came to run the administration as their fiefdom, as businessmen close to them made fortunes through their political connections. \n\nFor some, Mr. Bo&#8217;s attempt to revive Mao-era propaganda campaigns &#8211; such as mass rallies and &#8220;Red song&#8221; concerts &#8211; was an uncomfortable invocation of a troubled chapter in China&#8217;s history. His critics saw Mr. Bo&#8217;s populism as a thinly-disguised grab for power aimed at securing for himself a prominent position following the leadership change. \n\nMr. Bo&#8217;s rise to the top of the Party came to an unexpected &#8211; and dramatic &#8211; end last year, when his former police chief, Mr. Wang, fled to a United States Consulate in Chengdu in February, seeking protection after falling out with his boss. Mr. Wang&#8217;s flight to the Embassy of China&#8217;s greatest rival embarrassed the Party, and all but ended Mr. Bo&#8217;s career. \n\nTheir falling out was triggered by the scandal involving the murder of Heywood, a British associate of the Bo family who had been poisoned by Mr. Bo&#8217;s wife. Mr. Wang had helped the Bos cover-up the murder. \n\nThe unease caused by Mr. Bo&#8217;s politics was evident in a rare public criticism against his rule voiced by the former Premier Wen Jiabao, who at the Parliament session in March last year accused him of violating the consensus reached by the CPC in 1978 to draw a line over Mao&#8217;s Cultural Revolution and to take forward reforms. \n\nThe scandal provided the opportunity for Mr. Bo&#8217;s many detractors in the Party to halt his rise up the party ranks. After his sacking in March 2012 &#8211; a month after Mr. Wang&#8217;s flight to the U.S. Embassy &#8211; Mr. Bo and his associates were detained by party investigators. \n\nHis wife, Gu Kailai, was given a suspended death sentence &#8211; likely to be reduced to a life term &#8211; while Mr. Wang was given a 15-year jail term. Their relatively lighter sentences were seen as a reward for their cooperating with Party authorities. \n\nMr. Bo, however, remained defiant until the end, openly accusing the CPC of denying him a fair trial. The rejection of his appeal, however, has all but ended his controversial &#8211; and colourful &#8211; political career.

First it was Arsalan ul Mulk from Gujranwala whose Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was registered by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and now it is a former foreign services officer and lawyer Adnan Randhawa, 34, who wants to follow in Mr. Kejriwal&#8217;s footsteps. \n\nOn Monday, Mr. Randhawa applied to the ECP for a formal registration for his Aam Aadmi of Pakistan Party (AAPP). He was formerly with the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI), a party which has often been likened to the AAP in India. Yet Mr. Randhawa became disillusioned with the way things were going and the turning point came on March 3 when he saw the district court being fired at and bombed from his office overlooking the complex.\n\n\n<b>&#8216;Out of the box solution needed&#8217;</b>\n\n\nHe expected a strong statement from his party, which was not forthcoming, and it was still harping on a rapprochement with the terrorists. That was when he decided enough was enough and quit his party. He found it difficult to defend the PTI&#8217;s stand on terrorism and felt an out of the box solution was needed. A diplomat-turned political worker, he was posted in China for two years before becoming a protocol officer in Pakistan dealing with the Raymond Davis case, among other things. \n\n&#8220;On April 16, 2011 Davis was released and even as I was resigning, I heard he was being flown out of the country,&#8221; he said. \n\nHe began thinking it was politics and not bureaucracy which was the right place for him. &#8220;I was always keen on politics and felt it was the place where I could take up issues and make changes.

His new party will bear a resemblance to both the AAP in India and the PTI. He hopes to draw from workers of the PTI who are not status quoists and are sincere.\n\n\n<b>Urgent need</b>\n\n\nMr. Randhawa believes there is a felt need for such parties in India and Pakistan and the AAPP would fill a lacuna.

Dr. Afridi, who was convicted for his links with a banned terror group, Lashkar i Islam, in 2012 was suspected of helping the CIA track down Osama Bin Laden in Abbotabad under cover as part of a polio immunization programme in 2011.\n\n\nHis lawyer Samiullah Afridi told the Hindu on the phone from Peshawar that he had earlier demanded the setting aside of the sentence and a retrial in a plea to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) tribunal which had sent the case to the Commissioner, who is also the appellate authority. But instead of reviewing the case and passing an order on re- trial, the commissioner reduced the sentence and the fine, Mr Afridi said, adding that a fresh plea for a re-trial would be presented to the FATA tribunal next week.\n\n\nOn August 29, 2013 the Frontier Crimes Regulation commissioner in Peshawar, Sahebzada Anees ur Rehman, who later died in a mysterious fire in Islamabad in October, had set aside the trial and sentencing of Dr. Afridi. But in November 2013, Dr. Afridi was charged with murder in Khyber Agency for the death of a boy in 2006-07 during a surgery. \n\nThe case was registered by the Khyber agency administration over an incident which happened some years ago when he was practicing at a government run hospital in Bara. After his sentence was overturned, Dr Afridi continues to be lodged in Peshawar jail.\n\n\nIn December 2013, a FATA tribunal in Peshawar disposed of a review petition filed by Dr. Afridi seeking a trial by a sessions judge. The three- member tribunal which reviewed the case asked the FCR commissioner to clarify his predecessor''s order. \n\nThe tribunal held that the Commissioner in his order in August overturning the sentence was ambiguous about who should conduct a fresh trial in the case and sought clarity on whether it should be by a political agent or a sessions judge.\n\n\nThe US has put pressure on Pakistan to release Dr .Afridi and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson in January had said that there is no possibility of that happening at the US request. \n\nThe Pakistan government had expressed dismay at the US holding back $ 33 million till he was released. The spokesperson Ms Tasnim Aslam had then said that the matter was sub-judice. If the courts exonerated him that would be a different matter but he has been convicted and the review process is taking place, she said.\n\n\nShe had also clarified that the entire allocation for Pakistan is not linked to Dr. Afridi''s detention and only $ 33 million dollars was. \n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Bill 2014, approved by the US Congress which was signed into law by the President on January, 17, 2014, proposed to withhold US$ 33 million from assistance on account of Dr. Afridi''s detention.\n\n\nDr. Afridi''s lawyer had appealed against the 33- year sentence to the FCR Commissioner.

(604, '371', 'March 15, 2014', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/making-peace-with-the-enemy/article5785483.ece', 'Few expected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to give the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan another chance for a dialogue. At the end of his 20-minute speech in the National Assembly on January 29, when Mr. Sharif made his fateful announcement and appointed a four-member committee to further the peace process, there was more shock than awe. Even after the mandate of the All Parties Conference (APC) in September 2013 which favoured dialogue to settle the issue of terrorism, the process was flailing to say the least. And almost every single day after Mr. Sharif&#8217;s announcement, the country has been wracked by terror strikes in some form or the other. \n The admission of the Mohmand Agency faction of the TTP that it executed 23 security personnel in its custody was the last straw. The two committees entrusted with peace negotiations &#8212; one appointed by the government and the other by the TTP were at a stand-off over the issue of ceasefire, and any kind of a peaceful settlement seemed distant. Since then, in fast-paced developments, the TTP first called a month-long ceasefire on March 1, urging all its factions to stick to it, following which the interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, called a halt to the air strikes taking place almost everyday in North Waziristan and Khyber Agency, which were reportedly killing dozens of terrorists.\n While analysts believe that the air strikes softened the TTP stand and their offer of ceasefire must be treated with caution, there is a thaw in the dialogue process. How far this will take the government to any reasonable achievement is a big question. \nThis week, the government has gone a step further by replacing its committee with three bureaucrats apart from Rustom Shah Mohmand and the TTP nominees have travelled once again to meet the Taliban shura in Waziristan. Much ado was also made about Mr. Sharif&#8217;s visit to the hilltop residence of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief Imran Khan who endorsed the peace process.\nThe Mohmand TTP&#8217;s admission was not the first by the Taliban after Mr. Sharif&#8217;s peace offering. Its Peshawar faction brazenly admitted to the attack on a hotel frequented by Shias, and even displayed the terrorist Mast Gul, well known to Indians as the person responsible for the siege in Chrar-e-Sharif in 1995. The TTP also claimed responsibility for the bombing of a bus in Karachi on February 13 which killed 13 policemen. As terrorist hideouts were being bombed in North Waziristan on February 19, security officials were quick to point out that since the APC, 460 people have been killed in terror strikes and 1264 people have been injured.\nThe government tabled its long-awaited National Internal Security Policy in the National Assembly at the end of February and clarified that it was carrying out no planned operation but only surgical strikes, amid confusion that the military was going in for the kill. While the dialogue was on hold, the interior minister said that the armed forces had the right to self-defence and surgical strikes would be perfectly in order. \nBut on March 3, terror struck in the heart of Islamabad when the district and sessions court was torn apart in a suicide attack which killed 12 people, including an additional sessions judge. The interior minister sparked off a fresh controversy stating that the judge was killed by his own guard who, on panicking after hearing the blast, pulled the trigger of his 9 mm pistol. Faced with mounting criticism and pressure to opt for a military operation, the government has persisted with dialogue, separating the good Taliban from the bad.\nThe government knows, based on bitter past experiences, that an operation may not resolve the terror challenge. Right from 2004 when it has been trying to make peace with the militants, it has come a cropper. \nThe government&#8217;s detractors say it is not negotiating from a position of strength and there is confusion over the strategy being used to deal with the TTP. Making another appearance in the National Assembly, Mr. Sharif dispelled all confusion and made it clear that talks and terror strikes cannot go hand in hand. This has been reiterated time and again by various ministers and even the two committees preparing the ground for a dialogue. However, negotiating with the TTP is not just dealing with one entity but a hydra- headed monster. \nSuccessive governments have followed the same route &#8212; they have negotiated at first and even drawn up agreements as in the case of Swat, but have finally called the military as the Taliban showed no signs of backing down from its avowed aim of armed militancy and brutality. It is also becoming clear with the continuing terror attacks such as the one in Peshawar on March 14 that the TTP could have dissident factions which are not keen on any dialogue. \nIn the past, military operations have, apart from displacing lakhs of people, also resulted in the regrouping of the Taliban. Mr. Khan maintains that the government is in touch with the Taliban groups who want peace but does not specify who they are. At a time when a drawdown of coalition forces is imminent in Afghanistan and there is more uncertainty in the form of the Afghan elections, the last thing the government wants is a backlash from the TTP. \nPeace has never been so elusive or desirable for the Pakistan government. Faced with the limited success of a military operation, it is engaging with an enemy which is egregious and unrepentant. The start of the talks was not propitious and there is a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu of little coming of it. On the other hand, the government and the military say they can strike when needed, without resorting to a full-fledged operation. For now at least, that seems to have brought the TTP to the table once again and the peace dialogue seems to have been revived. \nThe TTP cannot be allowed to set the terms of the dialogue and then violate it with impunity. From all accounts it has accepted talks within the constitutional framework and called for a month-long ceasefire. Past experience shows that these assurances could crumble in minutes and could, in fact, be tactics to buy time. \nThe government which is faced with the humongous challenge of decimating terrorism has adopted this unusual committee-based approach. It has given the TTP a long rope but it&#8217;s difficult to imagine this turbulent adversary settling for peace.\n<i>meena.menon@thehindu.co.in</i>', 'Few,fateful,single,last,other,peaceful,interior,reasonable,big,first,responsible,quick,surgical,military,hold,interior,surgical,additional,fresh,own,military,good,bitter,clear,various,same,first,military,clear,such,past,military,imminent,last,elusive,desirable,military,egregious,propitious,little,other,military,constitutional,humongous,unusual,long,', ' desirable fresh good peaceful propitious reasonable responsible', ' bitter egregious fateful imminent little unusual', 7, -6, 1, 13),

Shahab, one of the guards, said he managed to free himself, only to find a gun pointed at his head. By then the huge fire in Ms. Minallah&#8217;s lounge and bedroom had attracted the neighbours who called the police. The attackers doused three guest rooms with petrol, staining the pristine white sheets.\nThe office near the gate is now a blackened shell and all the documents it stored have been charred. A mangled metal fan and a lock lie in the middle of the mess, along with a laminated photo of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, founder of AOL. Outside, there is burnt paper and a low cot which have evidently been saved from the fire. \nMs. Minallah was away attending an advance training course at a resort in Nankana, as the Lahore branch of AOL had insisted on hosting it. &#8220;We were actually planning to hold it here and that&#8217;s why my guest rooms were ready in preparation for the event.

The court directed the ministry to make adequate security arrangements for his appearance on Friday for indictment.\n\n\nThe defence produced a letter dated March 10 from the National Crisis Management Cell (NCMC) of the Interior Ministry titled ''Threat alert 239'' saying that it is reliably learnt that miscreants affiliated with the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan(TTP)/al-Qaeda have made a plan to target/assassinate Gen Musharraf in the near future. \n\nAccording to available information, the reconnaissance of all possible routes from the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology(AFIC) to the special court was already completed by the miscreants and hardcore fighters have been placed on the routes likely to be followed by his escort teams. It seems the terrorists have sympathizers in the security cavalcade of Gen Musharraf. The plan may materialize either en route using Improvised explosive devices or vehicle borne IEDs inside or outside the court similar to the Salman Taseer incident, the letter signed by Director, Security, Naseem ul Haq Hashmi, said, suggesting foolproof security and extreme vigilance. Punjab governor Taseer was shot dead by his bodyguard in Islamabad in 2011.\n\n\nThe ministry on Tuesday night had said it had only circulated a security alert from the agencies. The court summoned Secretary Interior Dr Shahidullah Khan who said that the letter was based on a report of intelligence agencies and it was a verbatim reproduction. He said it was his duty to inform all law enforcing agencies so that appropriate security measures could be taken. In response to questions from Judge Faisal Arab, he said that in the wake of the alert, 1600 persons were deployed on the route from AFIC to the court, the security personnel were changed and scanned and special branch was deployed as well. Combing and search operations along the route were also carried out. Justice Arab said if there was such a letter at least the prosecution and defence should have been informed. He asked if the accused was briefed on this as it could be mentally disturbing for him. Special Public Prosecutor Akram Sheikh said that the existence of a threat does not exonerate Gen Musharraf from appearing in court.

Justice Arab said he would fix Friday for the indictment as this would give enough time to beef up security measures and issued orders to the interior secretary accordingly. He said that in the circumstances, the court could not direct him to appear today.\n\n\nEarlier Justice Arab instructed some very reluctant security guards to remove defence lawyer Rana Ijaz from court after he made allegations about threats to his security and threatened to implicate the judge if some harm came to him.

Though 154 witnesses were examined as reported by the chief commissioner, the court observed that he was not in a position to give a conclusive opinion about the number of terrorists.\nThe IG''s report did not indicate whether there was any standard operating procedure (SOP) regarding the security plan for the district court premises. The report also did not say whether the remaining assailants were chased or any effort was made to contain them so they don''t escape, the court observed.\nThe IG was directed to submit an additional report on this within two days to the court.\n Meanwhile, the apex court also directed the Islamabad High Court to conduct its own inquiry and present its report to the Supreme Court.\nThe court ordered that till the investigation was completed, no public figure should make a statement on this matter after lawyers pointed to Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan''s speech in the National\n Assembly where he said that additional sessions judge Rafakat Awan was killed by his own guard.\nThe court came down heavily on the police saying "when will you understand how to tackle terrorism". Justice Azmat Saeed Sheikh said why don''t you go to a book shop and read up.\n The court questioned the lack of SOPs even though the country was fighting terror for over a decade.\n Meanwhile, Malik Khalid Noon, Mr. Awan''s reader, who was present in court, said the police were pressuring him to say that the judge was shot by his guard. He was threatened by a police officer that a case of murder would be filed against him otherwise. The reader claims he saw the attackers enter the court and fire at the judge. To this Mr. Awan''s elder brother Colonel (retd) Safdar Hussain said the reader was lying and the gun with the guard could not fire more than one shot accidentally. He said Mr. Awan was killed at close range and his chest was blackened.\nMr. Hussain said the reader had called another judge to say that Mr. Awan was killed at 9.18 am (local time) even before the bomb blast, which took place at 9.25 am (local time). The apex court did not comment on this and said it would wait till the investigation as complete.\n The court also ordered that the compensation be enhanced for the injured and the families of the victims which was now pegged at Rs. 75,000 and Rs five lakh respectively. This was considered too meagre an amount by the court.

After covering 3,300 km from Quetta, a journey that began on October 27, 2013, he and his fellow marchers reached Islamabad on February 28, with a long stop in Karachi. Walking the last part of his journey to Islamabad, Mr. Baloch told </i><b>Meena Menon </b><i>that his greatest wish was to visit India. Two years ago, when a United Nations team visited Quetta, he demanded an audience with them. He was invited to Islamabad as a result and decided to walk there. This was how the idea of this Long March was born. Mr. Qadeer&#8217;s son, Jalil was picked up by security agencies in Quetta in 2009 and his body was found three years later on the border with Iran. That decided things for him. He founded the &#8220;Voice for Baloch Missing Persons&#8221; in 2009. He has campaigned against extra judicial killings and illegal detentions and filed two cases in the Supreme Court, but to no avail. This march to the capital is his last stand for justice from a world body since he has no faith in the government. Excerpts from an interview:</i>\n\n\n<b>Why did you decide to have a Long March to Islamabad? And what do you hope to achieve?</b>\n\n\nWhen I founded the &#8220;Voice for Baloch Missing Persons&#8221; in 2009, a lot of young men and women had already gone missing. I felt that unless there is a platform for the families, no one would pay any attention to them. All the members of this organisation are related to the missing persons. The case for missing persons began in 1947 when Balochistan was forced to join Pakistan after it was freed from the Kalat state. Since then, we have been fighting the state and this brutal repression is the state response to our struggle. I used to work in a bank and I retired in 2009. My son, Jalil Reki was picked up because he was the Baloch Republican Party (BRP)&#8217;s central information secretary. I know it&#8217;s the intelligence agencies who did this because they called and told someone who was with him at that time. Three years later we found his body. Today, my grandson is marching with me because he also wants justice. So far, we have documented 19,200 missing people and recovered 2,006 bodies. The numbers increase every day. \n\n<b>How did you mobilise resources for your organisation and what has been the response? </b>\n\n\nPeople are calling me a RAW [Research &amp; Analysis Wing] agent and they think I get money from some agency. I don&#8217;t know this RAW and I have not seen or met anyone from there. I don&#8217;t need funds &#8212; there are over 19,000 missing people and their families contribute to the organisation and we also raise contributions. \n\n<b>You have filed cases in the Supreme Court? What is the progress so far? </b>\n\n\nYes, we filed two cases on missing persons in 2012 and there have been 102 hearings so far. We had asked for the missing persons to be produced in court. We contended that if people have done something wrong you have to punish them, not take them away or detain them and kill them. The situation in these detention centres is terrible. People cannot even stretch their legs, the rooms are tiny and they are blindfolded. In some of the bodies we recovered, we found holes drilled in the legs. We get a lot of bodies with the vital organs removed. \n\n<b>There are women too who are missing. </b>\n\n\nYes, there are women from the Marri and Bugti tribes who are missing. Women are taken away by agencies so that pressure can be put on their families to make sure their sons don&#8217;t join the various Baloch groups. We have documented cases of 170 women. Sometimes their children too are taken away. There is the case of Zarina, a schoolteacher, who was picked up in 2005 and her son, Murad was a year old then. How can a child survive without the mother? \n\n<b>Why is there no accountability for all these actions despite the Supreme Court case? </b>\n\n\nIt is the Pakistan state agencies which are doing all this. Balochistan was independent and we were forced to join Pakistan. Now, we want freedom from the Army. We waited for five years for justice but nothing happened. The United Nations working group had come to Quetta two years ago and later we were invited to meet them in Islamabad. We met the United Nations country office and the European Union delegation to Pakistan and we have two demands. We want the missing persons to be recovered and we want a separate Balochistan. We want the intervention of NATO forces or international support there to help us. There is no other way out. \n\nThe Supreme Court has managed to do one thing only. That is to establish that it is the ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence], the Frontier Corps and the military intelligence which have picked up our young men and women. There are so many orders to produce the missing persons but no one does anything. The security forces defy the orders and it is no use. For instance in the case of one of the marchers, Farzana, the court had ordered her brother to be produced in court but it was not followed. There are so many cases like this. There is no accountability at all. \n\n<b>Who inspired you to go on this march? </b>\n\n\nI had read somewhere that Mahatma Gandhiji had walked over 300 km to fight the British and they conceded to his demands. I thought if an old man like him could walk, so could I. Even Mao Tse-tung had a long march. The important thing was that Gandhiji made an impression on the British rulers. We hope that our demands too will be met after this long march which is over 3,300 kilometres. We walked for 108 days. \n\nAfter I formed my organisation, I got a lot of support from people. If there is a referendum in Balochistan, people will vote for independence. We have worked with honesty and integrity. All along the way, except in the Punjab, lakhs of people supported us. \n\n<b>How did you mobilise young women to walk with you? </b>\n\n\nIn Balochistan we observe strict purdah. Women don&#8217;t leave their homes but now people are so helpless, they have taken to the streets. \n\nThe young women with me have either lost a father or a brother. Their lives are miserable, some have left school for this march. They still hope their loved ones will be returned some day. This is our plight. There are nine girls and three children including my grandson on this march. \n\n<b>You faced a lot of threats and abuse during the march. </b>\n\n\nYes, people used to stop our march, get out of the car and abuse us. There was firing on us from moving vehicles and a truck dashed against two marchers injuring them. I was also threatened on the phone to stop the march. Even in Islamabad we are not safe. Even before I was leaving I got calls every day asking me to stop the march. An intelligence official threatened me that my other son would also be killed. For me the grief of my dead son is the grief of all the families who have lost people. In Punjab, we were openly threatened. In Gujarat, police blocked our march but we persisted despite all these problems and poor physical health. \n\nIn Balochistan, the young people continue to be picked up. Recently about 32 deaths have been reported and over 30 were taken away. It doesn&#8217;t stop. \n\n<i>meena.menon@thehindu.co.in</i>\n', 'long,last,Long,extra,judicial,illegal,last,Long,young,brutal,central,later,tiny,vital,sure,various,old,independent,later,separate,international,other,military,young,many,many,old,long,important,British,long,young,strict,young,miserable,other,poor,physical,young,', ' important independent sure vital', ' brutal illegal miserable poor strict tiny', 4, -6, -2, 10),

The NISP said dialogue offered a political means to end internal disputes but this is not the only option though it is the most preferred way to bring peace and reconciliation. Doors were open for negotiations with all anti-state and non-state groups within the limit of the Constitution and without compromising the primary interests of territorial integrity and sovereignty of the state.\nThe National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), designated as the focal organisation for coordinating counter terrorism efforts in Pakistan, in consultation with other institutions supporting NISP, will develop and coordinate a National De-Radicalization Programme Design. The policy envisages the integration of mosques and madrassas in the national and provincial educational establishment by mapping and then mainstreaming and integrating the existing and new madrassas and private sector educational institutions.\nThe policy said a large number of terrorists, either are, or have been students of madrassas where they were brainwashed to take up arms against the state. Therefore, the madrassa and mosque remains an important point of focus for any government policy to stem the spread of extremism in Pakistan. The policy recognised a need to develop a national narrative based on tolerance, harmony and the right of the people to make religious, political and social choices. De-radicalisation programmes will be conducted in jails for prisoners and terror convicts. \nThe madrassa system cannot be excluded from the internal security parameters of the country, the policy stated. Controlling funding of the terrorists is a major challenge especially when the curriculum in these madrassas does not prepare the youth for the job market. \nIt is proposed to tighten control over foreign funding to non-governmental organisations and madrassas by involving banks, the Federal Board of Revenue and taxation departments to monitor the flow of money to suspected organisations.', 'critical,national,key,political,internal,only,open,primary,territorial,focal,other,national,provincial,educational,new,private,educational,large,important,national,narrative,religious,political,social,internal,major,foreign,', ' educational important large open', '', 4, 0, 4, 4);

And it should have been allowed to rest there,&#8221; he said.\nThe Chief Minister said his worry now was that the BJP was making it an election issue. &#8220;67 kids becoming pawns to what is turning out to be pretty messy election is pretty unfortunate,&#8221; he said.\nHe was referring to the recent incident where Kashmir students were slapped with sedition charges, which were later withdrawn by the UP government, for cheering the Pakistan cricket team during the recent match against India. He went on to describe slapping of sedition charges against the Kashmiri students in Meerut as &#8220;over-callous&#8221;. \n&#8220;While what they did was misguided, I would go as far as saying that what they did was wrong. On one hand they are taking scholarship from the Indian Prime Minister and on the other hand cheering on like this.&#8221;\nBut having said that, the Chief Minister said cheering for a cricket team is not illegal. &#8220;It is this what makes this country great. I doubt whether something like this would be tolerated in our immediate neighbourhood. But it is the way we value our right to speech and if their free speech involved cheering another team so be it. I mean when our people go to Pakistan and Pakistani fans cheer the Indian team we absolutely feel really great about it,&#8221; he said.\nMr. Abdullah also categorically rejected the idea of joining the NDA alliance after the general elections and made it clear that his party National Conference was an ally of NDA earlier only because of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n&#8220;Our decision to join with NDA was only because of Vajpayee. We don&#8217;t see anybody in BJP today who is coming even close to what he was and therefore, the question of National Conference aligning with NDA simply does not arise.&#8221;\nTalking about the general situation in the state, the Chief Minister said the situation in Jammu and Kashmir may not be normal but they are beginning to be a &#8220;lot closer to normal&#8220;.\nAsked what would be his message for young Kashmiris, Mr. Abdullah, 43, said &#8220;I want to take out the uncertainty in their lives. The fact is they have been brought up on the diet of uncertainty &#8212; uncertainty about the future of Kashmir, uncertainty about their own future.&#8221;\nTo a question on whether he feared that the BJP would abolish Article 370 if it came to power, Mr. Abdullah emphasised, &#8220;they can&#8217;t touch Article 370 without the consent of the state.... It is a convenient tool that they (BJP) use during election and even shy away from discussion.&#8221;\nHe referred to BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi&#8217;s speech in Jammu earlier this year where he had sought a discussion on Article 370 to see whether it was beneficial or a burden on the state.\n&#8220;...and no sooner I replied back that I am ready for a discussion, name the time and the place and I will be there, the answer from the other side came that he is too busy and anyway you (Mr. Abdullah) are not important enough. So if that be the case, then that shows how seriously they want to discuss the issue,&#8221; he said.\nHe rejected a suggestion that there was a &#8220;Modi wave&#8221; but said there was definitely some effect. &#8220;A wave would be what you saw Rajiv Gandhi get after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, that is a wave and that is certainly not what Mr Narendra Modi is trying to get in this parliamentary election.&#8221;\nMr. Abdullah said that the final results may not be good for UPA but things can turn around. &#8220;I wish I had a crystal ball but I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said on the possible poll outcome.\nAsked about the lessons learnt during his stint as the Chief Minister, Mr. Abdullah said that &#8220;every day of this job, one learns&#8221; but the biggest lesson for him was that no problem is too small to be ignored.\nHe admitted that at the beginning of his term, he was slightly dismissive of some of the issues and said that the 2010 unrest was the &#8220;worst&#8221; period of his life.\n&#8220;I soon learnt that those smaller problems can quickly accumulate into one grand problem...such as the summer of 2010. That has been for me the worst period of my life I wouldn&#8217;t even say of my career. The summer of 2010 pretty much consumed me in every way possible. It did, it did change me. There is still a period of time that I have not gotten over. And I don&#8217;t ever feel that I will ever,&#8221; he reflected.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to go through that time when you are overseeing administration....but fortunately the good times over that situation prevailed and we had a few good years after that,&#8221; Mr. Abdullah said and thanked the &#8220;good people&#8221; around him especially his father and Union Minister Farooq Abdullah who always guided him.', 'other,administrative,messy,unfortunate,recent,later,recent,other,immediate,free,great,general,clear,former,close,general,normal,young,own,convenient,shy,beneficial,ready,other,busy,important,parliamentary,final,good,possible,small,dismissive,learnt,grand,such,easy,good,few,good,', ' beneficial convenient easy free good grand great important normal ready', ' busy close dismissive messy shy unfortunate', 10, -6, 4, 16),
(624, '371', 'March 7, 2014', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-tragic-end-to-storytelling/article5757462.ece', 'In many ways, the Pakistani media today is a microcosm of liberals in Pakistani society. The rules of the game they play are defined by fierce extremist forces, a fragile government and a dominant military. As a result, liberal voices in society prefer to silence themselves rather than fight a losing battle. \n&#8220;It is almost as if the Pakistani media is left with no option but to self-censor,&#8221; says Ayesha Siddiqa, an Islamabad-based political commentator. \nThe past two years have been particularly thorny for the Pakistani media with many journalists being killed or threatened at gun point. In January, Reporters Without Borders, a non-profit organisation which defends the freedoms of journalists, ranked Pakistan among the five deadliest countries for the media, just behind Syria and Somalia. Pakistani journalists have been killed in the line of duty at a rate of roughly one every 30 days for the past six years, according to the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists.\nThe Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issued a fatwa against the media in January, and prepared a &#8220;media hit-list&#8221; which includes the names of journalists, media-group owners, the news heads of various television channels and prominent anchors.\n&#8220;In a state of war, the first casualty is truth. Both the government and the extremist forces do not want truth reported,&#8221; says Haroon Rashid, editor, <i>BBC Pakistan</i>. &#8220;Hence we are threatened and silenced.&#8221; \nSenior journalists in Pakistan agree that the self-censorship exercised by the Pakistani media is subtle. For instance, after the killing of Punjab governor Salman Taseer in 2011, for his opposition to the blasphemy law, several newspapers stopped calling this law the Black Law. They fear to do stories against the law.\nSeveral Pakistani watchers say the situation has been tense for the media since 2001, when the NATO forces invaded Afghanistan, the repercussions of which were felt in bordering Pakistan. However, the extremist forces gained momentum and intensified as the years passed. In 2007, when various Islamist groups in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan that border Afghanistan formed an umbrella organisation called the TTP, the region effectively closed its doors to independent reportage. Mr. Rashid, who reported for the BBC from FATA in 2007, recalls being threatened by the tribals and the military alike. Now the FATA remains a black hole as far as news outflow is concerned. Any news that emerges from there is either military propaganda or the voice of some extremist force. \nThough there are independent media outlets in other parts of the country, self-censorship is pushing them the FATA way. &#8220;If there is no fearless reportage, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you have an independent media. That becomes a farce,&#8221; says Ms Siddiqa.\nJournalists admitted that they are pressured by the government to not report on the extremist non-state actors like the TTP, as the government feels it would give such groups legitimacy. The TTP killed 23 Pakistani soldiers in February, which stopped peace talks between the government and the organisation. \n&#8220;But before February, the government gave the TTP legitimacy by talking to them for so long,&#8221; retorts Mr Rashid. \nThis has brought the Pakistani media to a state where they are being forced to report extensively on the extremist forces. The editor of a Karachi-based Urdu newspaper, who asked to remain anonymous as he fears for his life, said he prints handouts and leaflets by the TTP without editing, to ensure that his newspaper remains afloat. Even most of the large newspapers that are Karachi-based steer clear of criticising the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) as they want to avoid trouble, says Ms Siddiqa. The Sindh-based political party has had a long history of violence.\nThe media hierarchy in Pakistan resembled that of India&#8217;s for several years &#8212; English language news outlets had little influence over the masses. Their target audience was the intelligentsia and a limited English-speaking population. However, in recent times, the militant forces have realised that English media outlets influence policy much more than the Urdu press as they have access to the people in power. They have begun to target them systematically as well.\nThe Express Media Group that reported extensively on religious freedom, minority rights, gay rights and child abuse is now facing the heat. The group which owns <i>The </i><i>Express Tribune</i>, <i>Express News, </i>and the Urdu-language newspaper <i>Roznama Express</i> has declared on record that it will regulate its opinion columns which are &#8220;rather too liberal,&#8221; though it maintains that its news reportage hasn&#8217;t changed, despite pressure from the extremist forces. &#8220;We have become more cautious in how we approach stories that relate to militant organisations. But we have not censored any news story. We cannot do that,&#8221; says Kamal Siddiqi, editor, <i>The Express Tribune</i>.\n&#8220;In January, a friend&#8217;s mother was killed by the Taliban in Kabul and I was so angry that I wrote an article articulating my anti-Taliban stance. I called for ordinary Pakistanis to counter the violent extremist narrative by committing to save one human life before they die. This article was turned down by <i>The Express Tribune </i>because three of its staffers had been shot at the same time,&#8221; says Muhammad Bilal Lakhani, a columnist for the paper.\nThree staffers of the Express Media Group were gunned down in January, and the spokesperson of the TTP immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. <i>The Express Tribune </i>has been attacked three times in the past six months.\nThe situation in Pakistan today, according to some analysts, is worse than in the 1980s when the country was under General Zia-ul-Haq&#8217;s regime. State-sponsored censorship was the order of the day then and there was forced regulation of media content. &#8220;During the 1980s, the newspapers refused to print if there was no freedom,&#8221; recalls Ms Siddiqa. &#8220;I remember seeing blank front pages of the <i>Dawn</i> back then.&#8221; \nBut there is a significant difference, several journalists point out. &#8220;With Zia we had to worry about our pieces being cut by a censor board and today we have to worry about our throats being cut by the TTP,&#8221; says Mr Lakhani.\nThere seems to be general resentment towards the Pakistani establishment. Everyone from the Urdu media to the English media feels that the government needs to do more. &#8220;If the government gave confidence to the media and did not ask us to fend for ourselves, we could have stood up to the militant forces,&#8221; says Mr. Rashid.\nThe Express Group, which faced flak recently from the civil society for openly stating that it was censoring its opinion pieces, says there is little media solidarity as well. The solidarity they received was from sections of the social media.\nThe freest of debates in Pakistan happen on social media. Though the social media&#8217;s penetration is limited to a few urban areas, it is slowly beginning to make inroads into other parts of the country. The social media is also giving voice to people who earlier struggled to have their say in policy matters. Several members of the Pakistani media believe that the social media, which is difficult to censor, could be the redeeming factor in the future.\nPakistan seems to be caught in a classic catch-22 situation. The country needs a robust media to support its groping democracy and a strong democracy to ensure a free media. Amidst this conundrum, the future of this neighbour could remain a cause for concern to India, given its political uncertainties in this election year.\n<i>(Raksha Kumar is an independent journalist working out of New Delhi and Bangalore.)</i>', 'many,fragile,dominant,liberal,political,past,thorny,many,past,various,prominent,first,several,tense,various,independent,military,black,military,independent,other,independent,such,anonymous,large,political,long,hierarchy,several,English,little,limited,recent,religious,liberal,cautious,relate,militant,angry,ordinary,same,past,significant,several,general,little,social,social,social,few,other,social,social,difficult,classic,strong,free,political,independent,', ' classic free independent large liberal prominent significant strong', ' angry black cautious difficult fragile limited little tense thorny', 8, -9, -1, 17),

(628, '371', 'March 5, 2014', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/pakistans-terror-conundrum/article5750648.ece', 'Despite being a country subject to and used to frequent terror attacks, the alarming upsurge in terror-related violence in January in Pakistan made people sit up. Nearly 40 personnel of the army and other security forces were killed in terror attacks between January 19 and 22, including one near the GHQ in Rawalpindi; 24 Shias were killed near Quetta by Sunni extremists on January 21. Daily killings in Karachi and attacks against polio vaccinators continue. These incidents are a reminder, if one was needed, of the enormity of Pakistan&#8217;s terror conundrum. Yet, a large section of Pakistan&#8217;s political class believes that the terror challenge can be met through dialogue.\nA conditional offer of talks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in the last quarter of 2012 was grabbed by political parties with significant electoral stakes in the Pashtun belt. However, there were no developments of note because of the impending elections. The TTP threatened the election rallies of all liberal parties, giving an edge to the conservative political segment. The approach of dialogue gained momentum after the May 2013 election, backed by the ruling PML-(N), Imran Khan&#8217;s PTI, the JUI (F) and the Jamaat-e-Islami. An all parties conference convened by the Nawaz Sharif government on September 9, 2013 adopted a resolution calling for an initiation of dialogue &#8220;with all stakeholders forthwith&#8221; and describing &#8220;respect for local customs and traditions, values and religious beliefs&#8221; as its guiding principle. The resolution was criticised in the liberal media for its cravenness, particularly in legitimising the TTP as a &#8220;stakeholder.&#8221; Heightened terror activity, including the killing of a major general followed, but was dismissed as being the handiwork of &#8220;foreign forces&#8221; by the votaries of dialogue.\nEven as the government was trying to bring the TTP to the dialogue table, its head, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike on November 1, 2013. Forgetting that he had the blood of several innocent Pakistanis on his hands, the religious parties described him as a &#8220;martyr.&#8221; Though a setback, his killing did not end government efforts to engage with the TTP. Mounting expectations of military action following the spurt in violence in January were dashed when Mr. Nawaz Sharif announced on January 29 his intention to give peace &#8220;another chance&#8221; and the formation of a four-member committee to talk to the TTP. \nInitial exchanges, surrounded by much uncertainty about the scope and content of dialogue, have ended abruptly because of the renewed terror activity, that resulted in the killing of over 30 security personnel. The army has carried out some air raids against militant hideouts. In a press conference on February 20, the Interior Minister was very hopeful of the dialogue process getting back on track!\nThe army leadership has been chary of talks with the TTP in order not to give them a breather to regroup and rearm. It is also because the army has lost many officers and men fighting the TTP. However, it has shown neither the will nor the capability to wage a decisive battle against the militants in the north-west. It conducted two major operations, in SWAT and South Waziristan in 2009, both in response to grave provocations. Its activities in other parts of FATA have essentially seen militants slipping away to other areas. A sizeable number of troops remain bogged down there. The army has also stonewalled repeated U.S. demands to conduct a military operation in North Waziristan, home to a veritable melange of Pakistani and foreign militants, including the army-friendly Haqqani network. Its reluctance has stemmed from not wanting to unsettle the Haqqanis and the uncertainty of success. According to Mr. Imran Khan, the army has told the government that an operation would have less than a 40 per cent chance of success.\nMr. Nawaz Sharif&#8217;s pursuit of dialogue is first and foremost the result of his desire to avoid a terror backlash in his home province of Punjab, which has remained relatively quiet since 2010, as a result of an operation against the TTP. He also has an eye on the sizeable conservative religious segment in his support base and the growing challenge from right wing parties, notably the PTI, who seek to exploit anti-American sentiment in Pakistan.\nThe dialogue approach is underpinned by the fallacious belief of many Pakistanis that terrorism will end when their country pulls out of the U.S. War on Terror. Its efficacy remains highly suspect for various reasons. Having repeatedly demonstrated its ability to mount high-profile terror attacks at will all over the country, the TTP seeks to dictate terms to the government. Moreover, it is very difficult to make headway with this conglomerate of at least 40 terrorist, criminal and sectarian groups. Each time some factions have shown the willingness to talk, others have sabotaged the move by staging brutal terror attacks. More importantly, the TTP&#8217;s aim is not to take Pakistan out of the War on Terror or establish its own system of governance in a limited area, but, endorsed by al-Qaeda, is to take control of the Pakistani state to use it as a base to spread its obscurantist ideology to other countries. The TTP, therefore, seeks complete surrender by the state.\nPakistan&#8217;s response to terrorism thus continues to be characterised by confusion, an absence of national consensus on a way forward, a lack of will and capacity to fight the menace and the consequent creeping surrender of the state to extremists and terrorists. Besides the TTP, which targets the Pakistani state, there are groups indulging in sectarian violence, those targeting India and others focussed on Afghanistan. Regardless of their motivation and orientation, all of them are ideologically and operationally fused. Meaningful action has not been possible against terrorists in Pakistan&#8217;s west because of the army&#8217;s reluctance to wage a conclusive battle against them, its unwillingness to target groups such as the Quetta Shura and the Haqqani network, and now the backing by a large section of the political class of dialogue. Anti-India groups in the east have not been touched because the army regards them as assets. Robust action has not been possible against the extreme Sunni groups as they have political links and have been used by the security establishment to settle scores with Baloch nationalists. If this situation persists, the result cannot but be a state of paralysis, greater instability and mounting lawlessness in the country. Growing instability apprehended in Afghanistan post-2014 will feed into this trend.\nWhat does it all mean for us? India-centric terror groups have naturally been our prime focus. However, they are a part of Pakistan&#8217;s larger terror conundrum, which we can ill-afford to ignore as an immediate neighbour. The success or failure of the Pakistani state in dealing with this existential threat would impact not only its own future, but also the security and stability of our entire region. What is needed is decisive and across-the-board military/police action against militant groups. An attempt to buy peace with the anti-Pakistan groups by offering them a secure foothold in a part of the country, for <i>jihad</i> outside Pakistan, will not succeed, because the prize they seek is the Pakistani state and there is the unbridgeable trust deficit between them and the army. That leaves us with the ongoing scenario of inaction and confusion. This can result only in greater instability in Pakistan, which will not leave us untouched. So, what can we do? An obvious answer is to keep our counter-terror machinery in top gear. Beyond that there are no clear-cut options. \nBecause of the nature of our relationship with Pakistan over the years, we have developed little positive leverage to influence Pakistan&#8217;s policy choices. However, there is now a growing and increasingly vocal section of people in Pakistan who are questioning the past policies of their country that have brought untold misery. They recognise that the use of terror against others has boomeranged on Pakistan and wish to engage with India constructively. They see the advantages of growing trade and economic links with India. Voices within this section of opinion have been questioning the wisdom of making a compromise with the Taliban. Such thinking must gain influence in Pakistan if it is to become a state at peace with itself and its neighbours. Therefore, our policy must not overlook the need to engage with this constructive segment in Pakistan, even as we contain and counter the dangers emanating from there.\n<i>(Sharat Sabharwal is a Central Information Commissioner and former High Commissioner to Pakistan.

Women tended to use tranquillisers, sedatives and painkillers, or prescription drugs but which are easily available. \n\nOf the 6.7 million users, 4.25 million were drug dependent. Charas, a resin obtained from marijuana was used by four million people and heroin by 860,000. In addition injecting drug users numbered 430,000. \n\nA challenge for Pakistan is the very limited treatment centres, especially for women, he said. With a high number of drug dependents, treatment and specialist intervention was available to less than 30,000 users a year. \n\nWhile poppy is grown in Afghanistan drugs are trafficked through Pakistan. \n\nA lot of the heroin and opiates are found here because it is at a crossroads of a big complicated business network as it goes to Europe, Asia and North America. \n\nPart of the shipments stay in the country, he said. There was a surge of 36 per cent in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan from 1994 to 2013 and Pakistan was one of the many transiting countries as 40 per cent of that yield went through it. \n\nPakistan is among 15 countries with high prevalence of HIV and there is a rise in the number of people who inject drugs. In 2005, 11 per cent of drug users were HIV positive but this number had risen to almost 40 per cent of the 430,000 who injected drugs in 2011. \n\nA majority of the population doesn&#8217;t have any idea about the risk of sharing needles and women also entered prostitution to make money to buy drugs, Mr. Guedes said. \n\nThe report said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have the highest levels of dependence. \n\nIt also called for wide-ranging policy changes to prevent drug abuse, training of professionals and HIV prevention apart from increased support of existing supply and demand reduction measures. \n\nOver 62,000 interviews were conducted for the survey. \n\nWith 74 per cent of the world&#8217;s poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, Pakistan was a victim as drugs were routed through here, said Mohammed Shahid, Director-General, Planning and Monitoring unit of the Ministry of Narcotics Control.

The narrow lanes of the congested court complex were full of blood and body parts as policemen wearing plastic gloves picked up pieces of flesh, some even stuck on the electric wires above. \n\nInspector General(IG) Islamabad Sikandar Hayat said that there appeared to be two or three gunmen who fired at people and threw grenades, one of which did not explode. Two suicide bombers detonated themselves, one outside the chamber of additional sessions judge Rafakat Ahmed Awan and the other outside a senior lawyer''s office, killing both. \n\nThe head of one of the bombers was found and two legs said to belong to another person were lying outside Mr. Awan''s chamber. A policemen was among those killed. \n\n<b>Pandemonium</b>\n\n\nThere was shattered glass everywhere and a small crater where a bomb exploded. After the firing, pandemonium swept the court complex with people running helter skelter. Nadeem Hassan, a lawyer told The Hindu that he knew Mr. Awan and he was made a judge last year. \n\n"I saw a leg in one of the offices of the lawyers, and heard gun shots and explosions." This was not the first time the district court was targeted, he said. There was a suicide blast some years ago and a politician had lost his legs. \n\nBlood stained walls and body parts lying in pools of blood and shattered glass bore testimony to the mayhem that was caused by the armed gunmen. \n\nEyewitnesses said there were four to six gunmen who fired at random. Murad, an advocate, said that there were more than ten attackers and they got out of two Land Cruisers."It was around 9.15 a.m.. I was standing near the bar room which was targeted with a grenade. Another bomb blast killed Mr. Awan and a woman," he said. \n\n"They had AK 47s and grenades in their hands and we ran to hide in one of the chambers," he added. \n\nThe court has virtually no security and the scanners were out of order. There were one or two policemen with pistols and it was 30 minutes before the security forces came and by then it was too late, he pointed out. "We took the injured and put them in private cars to rush them to hospital. There were no stretchers even and we used tin carts." It was later that two ambulances turned up. \n\n<b>Planned terrorist attack </b>\n\n\nMurad was going to meet Mr. Awan as he was dealing with a case in his court. "I was saved because I had to drop my sister off and I reached a few minutes late. He was a nice jolly man and we used to often joke with each other. Another judge Adnan Jamali was also shot at. This seems to be a planned terrorist attack and there was no security anywhere," he said. \n\nOfficial sources at the site said that there were two suicide bombers who were killed and two of the gunmen managed to escape. However, eyewitnesses said there were many more gunmen. Rana Abid Farooq was sitting in another lawyer''s office when the gunmen fired through the glass windows. He saw three gunmen wearing belts with bullets and wearing jackets. "We ran to the library and saw the gunmen from the top," he added. \n\nAnother lawyer Abdul Ghaffar lay on the ground under a chair to escape the firing."I was saved but four others in the office were badly injured," Gaffar said. "The attackers came from three sides and there must have been more than eight of them. In ten minutes, they managed to create hell. I saw two of them firing very calmly and at random," he said. \n\nEvery lane in the court compex had blood and no office was intact. The suicide blast outside block three destroyed all the three courts there and bits of blood and flesh were everywhere. \n\nGhaffar, who was with another lawyer Mian Abdul Razzak, said he heard shots soon after nine a.m. and thought it was some random firing. "Then it became continuous and we heard them in the chambers speaking Pashto. Three of them came and fired at us and threw a grenade and we couldn''t see anything. I still can''t hear properly," he said. Ghaffar and others hid till the police and anti terrorist squads came and extricated them. \n\nAnother lawyer Khalid Mahmood was going back to his office when he saw five young men - in their early 20s bearded and wearing shalwar kameez - carrying AK 47s and grenades with bags slung on their shoulder. They shot a senior lawyer Rao Rashid Iqbal Khan and moved to Gilani Hall near the canteen. Mr. Mahmood said the lawyers had complained a week before that the court was vulnerable and it has no CCTVs or proper security mechanism in place. Mr. Mahmood''s white sleeves were stained with blood as he helped carry the victims to hospital. "We found nine bodies and removed them," he said. \n\nAt 9.19 a.m., he called the Islamabad IG Mr. Hayat who said he didn''t know about the firing, Mr. Mahmood said. Lawyers have condemned the incident and called for a boycott of courts tomorrow all over the country. \n\nThe doctors at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences(PIMS) confirmed that eleven people were killed and 29 injured, five of them in a serious condition.

The custom called Swara in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is rampant also by other names in all provinces of Pakistan. Only in this case her father and brother opposed the resolve of the jirga or the tribal council, to hand over Asma. While they paid with their lives, her family continues to fight and managed to resist this heinous practice. These young girls are given away in marriage and often ill-treated and abused.\n\n\nDocumentary film maker and human rights activist Samar Minallah Khan has made films on the subject and also filed a landmark public interest litigation plea in the Supreme Court and over 110 cases of Swara, Vanni as it is called in the Punjab or Sang Chatti in Sindh were heard leading to punitive action. The apex court ruled that the police should take action and stop such incidents and file cases against those who did. In some of the cases she has filmed and documented, it is the men in the families who have opposed the young girls being given away in compensation for a crime committed by male family members. &#8220;These men are the real feminists here and in some cases in Sindh, the police and journalists took up the matter,&#8221; she said at a screening of her films on International Women&#8217;s Day on Saturday.\n\n\nLawyer and anthropologist Humaira Masihuddin said that whenever there is a fight or someone is in debt, they give away young girls as compensation. It is not the custom but it is embedded in customary law and it is very tough to challenge deeply ingrained practices. Swara is a deep-rooted manifestation of misogyny, she said and is a feature of all cultures which assign gender roles to women.

Where does honour go when a three-year-old girl is given away to settle a crime?&#8221; she asked.\n\n\nThough the Pakistan Penal Code was amended to make swara and similar practices a crime punishable with a maximum penalty of 10 years, the practice continues.

Iftikhar Murshed has pulled off a coup with a difference in a country inured to military takeovers. Within a short span of time, Criterion Quarterly, the magazine he launched in 2005, has become a byword among policy makers and the powers-that-be in Pakistan. With a modest circulation of 2,000 copies, it&#8217;s already being described as the finest publication of its kind in South Asia.\n\n\nMurshed served as ambassador to Moscow from 2000 to 2005 and as special envoy to Afghanistan from 1996 to 2000. In 2005, he resigned from government service to publish Criterion. &#8220;I had completed my memoirs when I was as special envoy to Afghanistan and we got the Criterion project moving. We wanted a magazine against religious extremism and religious terrorism, which is Pakistan&#8217;s number one problem. It&#8217;s all very well to say religious extremism or terrorism but it is broad-based; there is a link to the economy of the country, education, history and all other aspects. They all &#8212; singly and collectively &#8212; sort of impact on the ideology of terrorism,&#8221; he says. \n\nSo he got together what he refers to as some of the best writers in Pakistan and India and some from the U.S. as well. &#8220;Shaukat Aziz, when he was Prime Minister, wrote for us. I regret publishing his piece, but there were other superb pieces. For instance, A.G. Noorani from India has been writing on practically every issue and he has enriched this magazine.&#8221; Other writers include Khalid Aziz, who wrote on the causes of rebellion in Waziristan, Khalid Ahmed, and former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan Ishrat Hussain. \n\nWith his son, Mushfiq as editor-in-chief, Criterion &#8220;goes to politicians who study it and members of the diplomatic corps, many of whom have said they send back their dispatches after reading it, which I think is unfair. It is read seriously by the Pakistan army, and most of the politicians and members of the National Assembly and in universities. The idea is to formulate public opinion,&#8221; says Murshed. It is popular among youngsters appearing for the government services examination as well. \n\nOther magazines have a broad readership but they are not impact-based. &#8220;Ours is focused on impact, we aim at policy makers; we want to shape opinion,&#8221; he says.\n\n\nWhile it is available at select bookstores, its distribution will be improved. Web-based subscription is on the cards, apart from a Facebook page. The magazine is also available in Urdu with all its back-issues. Each issue is priced Rs.200. Murshed says, &#8220;Our objective is not money. One coup we achieved early in its formation. During the judicial crisis after the sacking of chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, we conducted a seminar on extremism and terrorism. Justice Ramde, who was presiding over the bench that reinstated Chaudhry, took five hours off at the height of the crisis to preside over our seminar. What the government didn&#8217;t realise was, and they got into a panic afterwards, that it was televised live. Some of the views expressed were pretty wild,&#8221; he chuckles.\n\n\nThe magazine is sustained by overseas Pakistanis who share a desire to make an impact; they are the ones who contribute monetarily. They are there to achieve long-term goals, he adds.\n\n\nIn a country riven by religious extremism, the magazine with its trademark buff cover, in-depth analysis and opinion, has gone that extra mile.\n', 'military,short,modest,special,special,religious,religious,religious,other,other,former,diplomatic,many,public,popular,broad,available,available,judicial,panic,wild,overseas,religious,extra,', ' broad diplomatic modest popular special', ' panic wild', 5, -2, 3, 7);

Doors were open for negotiations with all non-state groups within the limits of the Constitution and without compromising the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the state.\n\n\nThe policy said that global terrorism and armed conflict in Afghanistan had changed the internal security paradigm of Pakistan. Its economy suffered a loss of more than $78 billion in the last ten years and nearly 50,000 Pakistani citizens, including 5,272 members of armed forces and law enforcement agencies, were killed. \n\nAfter Iraq, Pakistan is the country most affected by terrorism. From 2001 to 2013, there were 13,897 incidents in Pakistan, which is marginally less than Iraq. From 2001 to 2005, there were 523 terrorist incidents in Pakistan, but the total number of incidents has risen to 13,198 from 2007 to November 2013. In 2013 alone, there were 1,361 incidents of terrorism. \n\nA trajectory of terrorist incidents in Pakistan shows that after the Marriott bombing in Islamabad and Lal Masjid incidents, the number of suicide attacks in Pakistan increased alarmingly, the policy document said. From 2001 to 2007, there were only 15 such incidents in Pakistan but it has risen to 358, between 2007 and November 2013, which is higher than anywhere else in the world. Another lethal trend is the use of Improvised Explosive Device (IEDs), which has emerged as the &#8220;weapon of choice&#8221; of terrorists.\n\n\nThe National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), designated as the focal organisation for coordinating counter terrorism efforts in Pakistan, in consultation with other institutions supporting NISP, will develop and coordinate a National De-Radicalisation Programme Design. The policy envisages the integration of mosques and madrassas in the national and provincial educational establishment by mapping and then integrating existing and new <i>madrassas</i> and private sector educational institutions.\n\n\nThere are 22,052 total registered <i>madrassas</i> according to government figures. Madrassas for women are also under the scanner after the Jamia Hafsa incident. The policy said a large number of terrorists, either are, or have been students of madrassas where they were brainwashed to take up arms against the state. Therefore, the madrassa and mosque remains an important point of focus for any government policy to stem the spread of extremism in Pakistan. \n\nThe policy recognised a need to develop a national narrative based on tolerance, harmony and the right of the people to make religious, political and social choices. Deradicalisation programmes will be conducted in jails for prisoners and terror convicts. The madrassa system cannot be excluded from the internal security parameters of the country, the policy stated. Controlling funding of the terrorists is a major challenge especially when the curriculum in these madrassas does not prepare the youth for the job market. It is proposed to tighten control over foreign funding to non-governmental organisations and madrassas by involving banks, the Federal Board of Revenue and taxation departments to monitor the flow of money to suspected organisations.\n\n\nThe implementation of NISP will require an estimated Rs 32 billion till December 31, 2014. The policy said while military operations in Swat and South Waziristan had removed any doubts about the inability of terrorists to withstand a well coordinated attack in open areas, the security apparatus has been unable to demonstrate other capabilities essential to successful counter-insurgency: to hold, build and integrate.

He said after the bomb attack on the policemen in Karachi and beheading of the 23 security personnel by the Taliban, the government had changed its policy while still welcoming talks.

The Prime Minister was clear; he said that talks and acts of terrorism cannot go together. The terror strikes didn''t stop and so he decided enough is enough, Mr. Nisar pointed out.\n\n\nThe dialogue was put on hold and it was decided that if talks had to go ahead, then the terror strikes must end. If there is continued terror activity then security forces will tackle it, that''s the basic understanding, he explained. The hideouts of the terrorists perpetrating the attacks will be targeted with precision strikes though the government wanted zero collateral damage, he said. \n\nIntelligence inputs were being used to target hideouts and homes of terrorists and the border areas.

He adds how religion never mattered even when a new boy joined school; concerns were more about how he would mingle with everyone, if he would be a good team member. The biggest loss for Mr. Chima has been the destruction of a &#8220;cosmopolitan multi-religious, forward looking pluralist society.&#8221; &#8220;I think the world is poorer because of that,&#8221; he says. \n\nWhat his wife Nasreen, 75, a former teacher, remembers best is her feisty mother, Rashida Ahsan, a class mate of Zohra Sehgal. &#8220;My mother was a great activist who had Hindu and Sikh friends. She spoke highly of her teachers: Sarojini Naidu&#8217;s daughter and Ms Zutshi, Nehru&#8217;s cousin. After college, Ms Naidu held meetings at her residence to discuss the independence struggle. My mother, who otherwise observed <i>purdah,</i> would mingle with Hindus and young people of all faiths. These were secret meetings,&#8221; she says. \n\nWhen Bhagat Singh was tried and sentenced, Ms Ahsan and other friends wrote placards in blood to protest but they were not allowed to carry out demonstrations. Her uncle, who was a magistrate, said he would get the placards distributed in public. &#8220;That was the spirit of Bhagat Singh,&#8221; Ms Chima says. Her mother once led a procession to the house of the divisional commissioner, a Sikh who knew her family. He refused to arrest her for violating prohibitory orders, saying his conscience wouldn&#8217;t permit him to do the same. \n\nHer house was like a refugee camp in those days, spilling over with women looking for lost children. Massacre is one thing and being separated from your family is another, Ms Chima says. &#8220;If the massacres had not happened then, this migration would not have taken place. We would still be a plural, diverse and a tolerant society. We are now intolerant, sectarian and we are going through hell. I don&#8217;t know how it will all end.&#8221; \n\nFor Dr. M. Naeem Qureshi, 77, former professor at Quaid-i-Azam University, Partition was a reality that he wishes happened differently. &#8220;My father was in the police and we had a lot of friends among Hindus and Sikhs. It never occurred to us that this would happen. But this is a reality and we can&#8217;t turn our heads from it. I only wish it had not happened the way it did. The fallout is that even today the two countries don&#8217;t have good relations. The human casualty, both psychological and otherwise, was staggering.&#8221; \n\nDr. Qureshi was one of the few Muslim students in the Sanatan Dharma high school in Sargodha. During Partition he once went to school wearing a Jinnah badge and was almost beaten up. &#8220;My father had subordinate officers who were Hindus. One boy, Sagar, had a father who was head constable. He eventually opened an artist&#8217;s shop in Sargodha. We prayed together and went sightseeing together. It was a wonderful life but when this movement started, I could feel us parting ways.&#8221; \n\nHe is still waiting for an objective history on Partition which has &#8220;not yet been written either in India or Pakistan as emotions are still strong on both sides.&#8221; Mr. Chima adds: &#8220;Partition is a process and the last word has not been said on it.&#8221; Perhaps the oral histories will leave a constructive legacy.\n\n\n<i>meena.menon@thehindu.co.in</i>\n', 'early,former,bright,young,interesting,archive,accessible,past,new,social,whole,other,whole,short,shikar,same,many,new,good,former,great,purdah,young,other,magistrate,divisional,plural,diverse,intolerant,sectarian,former,wish,good,psychological,few,high,subordinate,wonderful,strong,last,oral,constructive,', ' accessible bright constructive good great interesting strong wish wonderful', ' intolerant subordinate', 9, -2, 7, 11),

The PCB team was up against the Commonwealth XI led by Peter Heyward, the Australian High Commissioner.\n\n\nOn a more serious note, he said that peace was a top priority and the government could use any option to achieve this. While the peace dialogue is at a standstill, the military has launched air strikes on hideouts in the last few days, killing a number of terrorists. On the other hand, the bomb blasts haven''t stopped either. While the government is not forthcoming about whether it has launched an all out military operation, the TTP has said that it wants to talk but the ceasefire has to come from the government.

With infant and under five mortality rates at 74 and 89 deaths respectively per 1000 live births in the five -year period before the latest 2012-2013 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey(PDHS), the country&#8217;s chances of meeting the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) looks very dim.\n\n\nTanvir Kiyani, director (research and survey), National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS) which carried out the survey, said the MDGs had set IMR at 40 per 1000 live births and Pakistan was a long way off. For the first time, questions on domestic violence were included in the survey, she pointed out. \n\nOne-third of married women or 32 per cent have experienced physical violence since the age of 15 and one in five women experienced physical violence in the last 12 months. Women in poorest households are more vulnerable &#8212; 25 per cent &#8212; and violence in most cases &#8212; 79 per cent &#8212; is perpetrated by the husband. Eleven per cent women also experienced violence during pregnancy. Almost 40 per cent of women have suffered abuse from their husbands at some point in their life and one-third of them reported some form of physical or emotional violence by their husbands in the last 12 months.\n\n\nThere was huge resistance to including questions on sexual violence, which was dropped, and even the domestic violence questionnaire was inserted with great difficulty, Ms. Kiyani said. Women do not have the power to make decisions and more than one-third of them have no say on health care, or visits to family or relatives or on major household purchases. About 43 per cent women and one-third of the men agree that a husband is justified in beating his wife if she argues with him, neglects the children or in-laws, refuses to have sex, goes out without telling the husband, or burns food. About 34 per cent women agree that if they argue with their husbands, it is justified if they are beaten.\n\n\nKey findings of the survey presented at a recent meeting at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute indicated that Pakistan was lagging behind in various health indicators and there is urgency for planners to take stock of the situation and implement policies. The PDHS survey reported that 45 per cent children under five are stunted or too short for their age, indicating chronic malnutrition and 30 per cent are wasted or too thin for their age. Only 14 per cent women are thin while 40 per cent are overweight or obese.\n\n\nAbdul Basit Khan, executive director of NIPS, said lack of education, financial constraints, wars and religious extremism had contributed to the situation and instead of fighting with India, Pakistan should learn from it on the health front.\n\n\nChildren in rural areas are more likely to die young, with under five mortality at 106 per 1000 live births, while in urban areas it is 74/1000 live births, the survey said. \n\nNeonatal mortality at 55 deaths per 1000 live births has remained unchanged for the last 20 years. Ms. Kiyani said a national representative sample of 13,558 married women between 25 to 49 and 3134 men in one-third of the selected households were interviewed. \n\nPakistani households consist of an average of 6.8 persons and about 39 per cent of the population is under 15. Only 11 per cent of households are headed by women, the survey says. \n\nFertility has decreased from 5.4 births per woman to 3.8 in the last 23 years. Women who have a higher education have a fertility rate of 2.5 while for illiterate women it is 4.4. Thirty-five per cent of women were married at 18 and more than half &#8212; 54 per cent &#8212; by the age of 20.\n\n\nKnowledge of family planning methods is universal with 99 per cent women and 95 per cent men knowing at least one modern method of family planning.\n\n\nInjectable contraceptives are the most popular along with the pill and sterilisation among women. The use of modern family planning methods has increased from 9 per cent in 1990-91 to 26 per cent in 2012-2013. While half the births occur in health facilities, home births are common in rural areas -60 per cent -while in urban areas it is 32 per cent. For women there are problems in accessing health care and only 54 per cent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received all recommended vaccines, the survey said.

Yet on Saturday morning, undaunted, they continued their march to the capital.\nRinged by handholding masked young men, Mr. Baloch and his brave band of followers walked in a slow procession from the Faizabad junction to the National Press Club Islamabad, and a modest crowd of supporters showered them with rose petals as they wheeled a small cart with framed photos of young men and women who had gone missing in Balochistan in the last decade or so.\nFarzana said that she and the other marchers had to seek refuge for the night in the house of a well-wisher. "My toe nails have fallen off, I have lost weight and my skin is badly damaged during the march from Quetta since last October. Most of us have fallen ill and the strain is showing," she said.\nAmong the marchers are nine young women and three children, all of whom have lost a member of their family. Farzana said her life has been disrupted after her brother Zakir, a Baloch student leader, was taken away by security agencies some years ago. "We are struggling to cope with his loss and my family is bereft," she added.\nSixteen-year-old Sammi Baloch feels that despite walking for so many days and such a long distance, no one really cares about their plight. "We still have some hope of justice, otherwise we wouldn''t be out walking on the streets," she said. The whereabouts of her father who was picked up by security agencies is still unknown.\nMost of the young girls like Samina who studies in the 7th class and her younger brother Ali Haider have left school to take part in the march. Their father Mohammed Ramzan is missing. She hopes the United Nations will do something for the cause as the government was just ignoring their plight.\n"We faced a lot of difficulties during the march but we don''t want to talk about it. It is justice we are after," says the teenager. Mr. Baloch said that during the march people abused and threatened them at certain places and in some instances even fired at them from moving vehicles. A truck hit two of the supporters, injuring them. He said the organisation he founded, the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons had requested a meeting with the United Nations when the UN Working Group had visited Balochistan two years ago.\n"We were invited to meet them in Islamabad and we decided to walk the over 3300 km from Quetta in a bid to highlight our situation and seek UN intervention," he said.\n The group used to cover 40 km a day when it set out on October 27, 2013 and has marched for over 100 days to get to the capital. He said security agencies continued to pick up people and kill them. Mohammed Ali Talpur, a senior activist, who was part of the march from Karachi, said that this was a message of defiance to the government and by bringing the march to the heart of the establishment, the people of Balochistan wanted to show case their plight.

Even after so many peace initiatives in the region for 35 years, women&#8217;s agenda did not occupy a place in peace movements or discussions, she pointed out. &#8220;Unless we have ownership and internalisation of the need for women&#8217;s participation, things will not change.&#8221; On Kashmir, she said she has not been able to convince men that women needed to be on peace committees.

The other was moving away from seeking strategic depth or avoiding power brokering in Afghanistan by seeking no favourites.\n\n\nThe Bilateral Security Agreement could be signed post elections and the foggy timeline had added fresh uncertainty, she said. There was much to worry for Pakistan as there would be multiple transitions and most of it up in the air. The west was looking to cut its losses and it was less and less interested in preserving the fragile gains in Afghanistan, she said.

The problem he said is that extremism had created huge problems for the state and while the government can still talk it cannot evade its responsibility.

The government has suspended peace talks with the Taliban, which began early in February; combat jets have bombed <i>jihadist</i>-held territory in North Waziristan.\nYet, there&#8217;s been little real outrage: no giant protest rallies, nor politicians vowing vengeance. Nor has the door been closed on future talks, even with the killers. &#8220;Such incidents have an extremely negative impact on the ongoing dialogue aimed at promoting peace,&#8221; said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &#8212; words with all the passion of a telemarketing call.\nFor reasons that aren&#8217;t hard to understand, the massacre will most likely be remembered &#8212; just like a welter of other massacres of both civilians and troops &#8212; as just another milestone towards Pakistan&#8217;s disintegration into a theocratic dystopia.\nIn another video, this one recorded in the spring of 2004, Nek Muhammad Wazir stands on a stage set up near his home in the Shakai valley, happiness suffusing his face as the commander of Pakistan&#8217;s XI corps places a wreath around his neck. &#8220;The tribal people,&#8221; he tells Lieutenant General Safdar Husain, &#8220;are Pakistan&#8217;s atomic bomb.

Helped by Pakistan&#8217;s intelligence services, who had long seen them as strategic assets, they allied with Islamists in the region, violently displacing the traditional tribal leadership.\nFacing intense pressure from the United States, President Pervez Musharraf eventually ordered a limited offensive into South Waziristan, only to find his commanders didn&#8217;t have the resolve or skills to win the war.\nHe turned, instead, to deal-making. The so-called Shakai agreement, with Nek Muhammad Wazir, was hailed as a major success for this policy.\nThe dispiriting experience didn&#8217;t stop the Pakistan Army from trying again. In February 2005, the Pakistan Army signed another peace deal with South Waziristan warlord Baitullah Mehsud, who would go on to lead the Tehreek-e-Taliban. This time, the Pakistan Army tried to solve the problems it faced with Hakimullah Mehsud, by not calling on him to surrender his al-Qaeda linked allies. Like in the earlier peace deal, though, fighting continued apace.\nIn August 2009, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) drone strike finally eliminated Mehsud &#8212; but attacks on the Pakistan Army still continue, carried out by the men he commanded.\nMaulana Fazlullah, now the head of the Tehreek-e-Taliban, himself built his power on the back of these peace deals. For years, Fazlullah had used radio broadcasts &#8212; and violence &#8212; to call for shari&#8217;a law in the Swat Valley. The Pakistani armed forces gazed on benignly.\nIn 2008, voters backed the secular Awami National Party (ANP)-led coalition government in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. Fazlullah&#8217;s violence surged, and in February 2009, battered by assassinations and suicide-bombings, the ANP conceded his demands. Swat became a dystopia, characterised by floggings and beheadings.\nThe author of last week&#8217;s massacre, warlord Abdul Wali &#8212; who prefers the pseudonym Omar Khalid Khurasani &#8212; was among the Lal Masjid <i>jihadists</i>. He himself signed a prisoner-exchange and peace deal with the Pakistan Army in May 2008. In return, the army allowed the Islamist warlord to exercise power across the Mohmand Agency. &#8220;Polio vaccination was stopped, shariah courts were established, women were directed to wear the veil in public and criminals were arrested and judged in Sharia courts,&#8221; the journalist Amir Mir records.\n&#8220;None of the agreements with Taliban factions involved in attacks in Pakistan,&#8221; expert Daud Khattak has noted, &#8220;lasted for more than a few months.&#8221;\nIn a CIA archive somewhere there&#8217;s a video of this too: less than three months after the Shakai deal, a &#8216;Hellfire&#8217; missile locked on to Nek Muhammad&#8217;s home as he was eating lunch, guided by a signal broadcast from a chip planted by an Inter-Services Intelligence agent. It was the CIA&#8217;s first drone strike in Pakistan. Last week&#8217;s executions, the Taliban says, were intended to avenge the killing of Baitullah Mehsud, the peace-deal beneficiary of 2005. Abdul Wali, more likely than not, will die, too &#8212; but that won&#8217;t end the war, either.\nThis is because the conflict isn&#8217;t about primitive religious fanatics battling the state: it is, instead, an irreducible ideological conflict about what Pakistan ought to be. The <i>jihadists</i> see themselves as revolutionaries fighting to overthrow a corrupt oligarchy, and build a utopia based on the word of god. Their methods might be repulsive, but many Pakistanis don&#8217;t disagree with their ideals.\nFrom its moment of birth, this conflict has stalked Pakistan. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan&#8217;s founding patriarch, appeared to promise a secular state in his August 1947 address to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan: &#8220;you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques.&#8221; Yet, as the scholar Pervez Hoodbhoy has pointed out, Jinnah&#8217;s speeches &#8220;do not contain a single occurrence of the word &#8216;secular&#8217;.&#8221; &#8220;He refers repeatedly to the &#8216;fundamentals&#8217; of the shari&#8217;a and Quranic law,&#8221; Dr. Hoodbhoy notes, &#8220;without ever specifying what those fundamentals are.&#8221;\nLike Muhammad suggested in his speech at Shakai, the Taliban see themselves as patriots &#8212; determined to realise that dream.\nIn this, the Tehreek-e-Taliban are in fact a descendants of a tradition that dates back centuries: clerical networks regularly battled both imperial power, using faith as a language for resistance. The clerical push for power over Pakistan&#8217;s destiny resumed soon after its independence. In 1951, the Majlis-e-Ahrar, a religious alliance, initiated an agitation calling for members of the heterodox Ahmadiyya sect to be declared non-Muslims. They precipitated massive violence, forcing the imposition of military rule in 1953. Pakistan&#8217;s 1956 constitution, hoping to deny the fundamentalists ground, decreed it an &#8220;Islamic republic.&#8221;\nLater, in 1961, General Ayub Khan gave institutional form to the idea of the Islamic state, setting up an Advisory Council of Islamic Ideology to ensure there was no conflict between the laws of god and the laws of man. Now remembered as a socialist, it was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who declared Islam the state religion. He also introduced the first new blasphemy laws. Finally, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq decisively transformed the state into an instrument for the perpetuation of neoconservative Islam.\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whose Pakistan Muslim League has been long allied with religious reaction, has less reason to change course than most. The murderously anti-minorities Lashkar-e-Jhangvi helped ensure his party&#8217;s sweeping success in Punjab during the last elections. Mr. Sharif hopes that he can use anti-<i>jihadists</i> in Punjab, like the Lashkar-e-Taiba&#8217;s Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and the Jaish-e-Muhammad&#8217;s Masood Azhar Alvi, to serve as counterweights to the Tehreek-e-Taliban. Even a victory for this project, though, will strengthen the <i>jihadist</i> vision of Pakistan &#8212; not roll it back.\nFor decades, Dr. Hoodbhoy wrote, Pakistanis have been taught that the country&#8217;s &#8220;raison d&#8217;Ãªtre was the creation of an Islamic state where the shariah must reign supreme.&#8221; The battle is over who can best manufacture this dystopia, not the idea itself.\n<i>praveen.swami@thehindu.co.in</i>', 'blue,tidal,jihadist,remarkable,jihadist,little,real,giant,future,negative,ongoing,likely,other,theocratic,atomic,few,later,foreign,strategic,traditional,tribal,offensive,major,secular,last,public,few,archive,first,likely,primitive,religious,irreducible,ideological,corrupt,repulsive,many,birth,secular,free,free,single,clerical,imperial,clerical,religious,massive,forcing,military,Later,institutional,first,new,instrument,neoconservative,religious,last,jihadist,', ' free imperial real remarkable traditional', ' corrupt little negative offensive primitive repulsive', 5, -6, -1, 11),

Mr. Aziz also said Pakistan was not planning to supply arms to Syrian rebels.\n\n\nHis clarification comes after a controversy erupted over a joint statement issued at the end of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Salman Bin Abdulaziz to Pakistan earlier this month. On Monday in the National Assembly members wanted to know why the country had changed its stance towards Syria. The joint statement on February 17, said among other things, that &#8220;The two sides reiterated the need for finding of a quick solution of the existing conflict in Syria according to Geneva I Resolution in order to restore peace and security in Syria and prevent bloodshed. In this regard both sides called for the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers enabling it to take charge of the affairs of the country, apart from the immediate withdrawal of all foreign armed forces and elements from Syrian territory and lifting of the siege of the Syrian towns and villages and stopping aerial and artillery bombardment.&#8221; \n\nMr. Aziz said he rejected the charge that by demanding a transitional governing body in Syria, Pakistan had changed its foreign policy. He said the demand was made in keeping with the communiquÃ© issued by the UN Backed Action Group for Syria in Geneva on June 30, 2012 which called for the establishment of a transitional governing body with full executive powers that could include members of the government and opposition, and should be formed on the basis of mutual consent. \n\n&#8220;We have issued a statement identical to the consensus document adopted by the international community and there is no change in our written position on Syria. Our policy is neutral,&#8221; he said, adding that reports of a change were misleading. \n\nHe also rejected news reports that Pakistan may supply arms to Syrian opposition. As it is a responsible state it demanded end user certification among a host of other things if it was selling arms. News reports had said that Pakistan was considering a plan of arming Syrian rebels under pressure from Saudi Arabia which was also denied by the Foreign Office. \n\nHe said that various matters were discussed during the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince including defence cooperation. He said he wished to correct the impression that Pakistan had changed its foreign policy under pressure. &#8220;There was nothing new in the joint statement issued with Saudi Arabia and it was in keeping with our declared position on Syria,&#8221; he added. \n\nHowever, Opposition members Naveed Qamar and Shireen Mazari said that Pakistan had observed strict neutrality on Syria and demanding a transitional governing body was tantamount to interfering in the internal affairs of a country. Mr. Qamar said Pakistan was calling for a regime change and opposing military operations in other countries at a time when its own military was conducting air strikes on terrorists. \n\nHe said the country should get its own house in order before interfering in the affairs of others. \n\nDr. Mazari said earlier Pakistan had a principled stand and it had demanded a transitional authority. The government had moved away from its position of neutrality towards Syria, she said.

Mr. Akbar had filed <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings in the Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court which ordered the Ministry of Interior to ask the intelligence services to produce Mr. Khan by February 20.\nReprieve said Mr. Khan plans to go ahead with his trip to meet parliamentarians in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands later this week. He was quoted as saying that when he was picked up, he thought he would never see his family again and that he would never be freed going by all the stories he had heard about disappeared people. He thanked activists and lawyers who had helped secure his release.\nMr. Khan, whose son and brother were killed in a drone strike, was going to leave on Saturday to Europe to speak about the drone strikes to members of European parliaments.

The corridor envisages expanding road links, building a railway line and installing energy pipelines running from the western Xinjiang region to Pakistan through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), which provides the only land link connecting the two countries. \n\nOn Wednesday, following talks between the two leaders, both sides only announced more modest agreements that had been expected. \n\nOf the four deals signed, one was to upgrade the second phase of the Karakoram Highway, which runs from Xinjiang, through PoK, all the way to Islamabad. The second was for the building of an international airport at Gwadar. \n\nIt is understood that both agreements are, however, yet to be fleshed out. Asked by <i>The Hindu</i> about China&#8217;s planned investment into the two projects, Luo Zhaohui, Director General of the Foreign Ministry&#8217;s Asian Affairs Department and its top official on Asia policy, said the two sides were still in discussion. \n\nBoth sides also did not announce any agreement on the proposed investment fund. Asked about the Pakistani proposal, Mr. Luo said the idea needed to be worked out. &#8220;It is the intention, but we will have to see how it will be carried out,&#8221; he said, adding both sides &#8220;have a positive attitude on cooperation.&#8221; \n\nMr. Luo described the economic corridor plan as a priority. Both countries hope the long-discussed plan, which was revived last year, will answer sceptics who have pointed out that the lofty rhetoric often been used to describe ties as being &#8220;higher than the Himalayas&#8221; has, in recent years, not been reflected in actual Chinese financial or material support to its &#8220;all weather&#8221; ally. \n\nWhile the difficult terrain has historically been an obstacle to boosting land connectivity, in recent years many Chinese firms have become wary of the security situation in Pakistan, following a number of kidnapping threats aimed at Chinese workers.\n\n\nThe Gwadar port project, strategically located on the Arabian Sea coast, has also stagnated, officials acknowledge. Last year, a Chinese firm took over the operational contract for the port from a Singapore company in the hope of reviving the plan.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the only other two agreements signed were for the establishment of research institutes for small-scale hydropower technology and to set up Confucius Institutes in Pakistan.\n\n\nNo agreements on new nuclear projects were announced, although Chinese officials said cooperation in this field would continue. Last year, China and Pakistan signed deals for two 1,100 MW reactors in Karachi.\n\n\nChina is also building two reactors at Chashma, C-3 and C-4, where it has already constructed two reactors. Pakistan is understood to have proposed agreements for three more reactors, citing its energy shortage.\n\n\nDuring Wednesday''s talks, Mr. Xi said the Pakistani President was the first foreign leader he had hosted in the new "year of the horse", with the Chinese new year falling on January 31. This showed the "special nature" of the relationship, he said.\n\n\nThe Pakistani President told Mr. Xi "coming to China is like coming to my second home".

He also pointed out that a statement of the formal charges was already given to the defence team.\n\n\nThere was much expectation since proceedings began at around 9.30 am that Gen. Musharraf would appear and when the judge asked the defence counsel Anwar Mansoor about his client, Mr. Mansoor said he was going to appear soon in court. However, after the break when the court asked again, Mr. Mansoor said the senior superintendent of police, Islamabad, was not willing to take over charge of the convoy from the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC) in Rawalpindi where Gen.

Mr. Sheikh intervened and said there were 1100 troops to guard the route and since Gen. Musharraf was not under arrest and a free man he should come. The court was then told that the issue was complicated by the AFIC commandant, who demanded a receipt for Gen. Musharraf''s custody since the police are saying he was not in their custody either. Mr. Sheikh then asked the court to direct the commandant suitably.\n\n\nFinally, Justice Arab directed the court registrar to speak to the AFIC commandant. Gen. Musharraf''s convoy drove right up to the door of the National Library auditorium, which is the venue for the special court, and the former military ruler walked inside a little after one pm. He was surrounded by Rangers and top police officials and his defence team stood up and clapped to welcome him. \n\nHe was seated when the three judges entered and Justice Arab asked him to stand up briefly. "Since he has appeared, we can decide the question of jurisdiction," Justice Arab said. The proceedings were over in about 20 minutes and outside Gen. Musharraf spoke to a couple of journalists, who asked him how he was feeling.

Whether it was the security guard in Sindh Assembly or journalists at the Karachi Press Club or a writer in Islamabad who wanted to treat me to a Sindhi meal, what mattered was neither my nationality nor my faith; just that I was a Sindhi. As I marvelled at the way journalist Shams Keerio and his friends packed the gifts they had flooded me with, they shrugged away my gratitude, &#8220;Think of us as handymen from Ulhasnagar.&#8221; The Sindhi township on the outskirts of Mumbai was familiar to most Sindhis; and almost every Sindhi asked about the state of the language in India.\nThe strength of this bond was best exemplified by journalist Syed Karam Ali Shah&#8217;s story. His grandfather, after whom he&#8217;s named, was a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Hyderabad (Sindh) during Partition. As the Hindus fled Sindh, he forbade his neighbours &#8212; the famous Seth Vishindas family &#8212; to leave and guaranteed their safety. The friendship has stood the test of time. The DSP&#8217;s daughter, now 78, stays with her Hindu friend whenever she comes to visit her son in Karachi. The two friends gave birth within a day of each other on adjacent beds in the same hospital. Their children grew up playing Holi together. &#8220;We visit their temple during Diwali; I&#8217;ve also gone to the Sadhu Belamandir (in Sukkur),&#8221; says Karam Ali. &#8220;Didi Indra even took my mother to India when her nephew was getting married.&#8221; That was in 1992, when the Ayodhya agitation had polarised Hindus and Muslims in India.

As a young man working for British Petroleum in Qatar, Kazi&#8217;s friendship with Pakistanis led him to see the newly-born country as a land of opportunity. Despite fierce opposition from his family in coastal Konkan, he came away in 1950 finding a home amid Konkanis in Karachi&#8217;s Bombay Town. But when it was time to marry, he returned to his village, Murud, to wed someone who could speak his language; when his children were born, he returned again, to show them his ancestral village.\n&#8220;<i>Kashiaahestu</i>?&#8221; asked the wife of barrister Khurshid Hashmi, principal of Karachi&#8217;s S.M. Law College. As soon as he heard I was from Mumbai, the principal called up his wife: &#8220;You&#8217;re always grumbling that there&#8217;s no one who can speak your language; here&#8217;s someone from your state,&#8221; and handed me the phone. The voice at the other end talked longingly about Pune, its &#8220;cultured citizens with their fierce loyalty&#8221; to their city, and about her alma mater, (Nowrosjee) Wadia College. Had I had more time, she would have insisted that I come over for a meal.\nHer effusiveness towards someone from the state she had left behind is understandable but how does one explain her husband&#8217;s graciousness? His father, a prominent Muslim Leaguer, had been hacked to pieces by a mob on August 28, 1947, while returning from his farmhouse in Punjab; his mother had been just 26. An elderly Sikh neighbour had persuaded them to leave and escorted the family, including Hashmi&#8217;s grandmother, to a refugee camp in Jalandhar. His father had been a landowner; the house they were given in Karachi resembled a cattle shed. He remembers coming home from school to find his mother weeping. His elder sister, who&#8217;d seen their father killed, woke up screaming at night. In all, 48 members of his family had been killed, said the principal, pausing frequently to control his emotions. &#8220;That was not the way to divide the country. We were co-existing peacefully.&#8221;\nEven while expressing gratitude to &#8220;this land and its people&#8221; for having &#8220;received us with an open heart&#8221;, Hashmi hoped he could see his village once more some day. Understanding my desire to see his college, which had been my father&#8217;s alma mater, he traced the copies of my father&#8217;s admission forms.\nThese were Muslims who&#8217;d made Pakistan their home, but still carried a yearning for their lost homeland. On the other side was Manmohan Singh, who despite having to pay jiziya to the militant &#8220;Lashkar-e-Islam&#8221;, had chosen to stay on in Khyber Agency rather than migrate to India. The <i>jiziya</i> &#8212; &#8220;only Rs. 1000 a year&#8221; &#8212; kept the Sikhs secure, he said; besides, Muslims had to pay much more. Indian Sikhs, rued Singh, had lost their way. Three Sikh families that he knew had migrated to India but returned disillusioned. &#8220;The Taliban admire us for the way we uphold the principles of our faith; they wish Pakistan&#8217;s Muslims would do the same,&#8221; he said. \nThe flip side was narrated by a Pakistani Muslim whose family hailed from Madhya Pradesh. His cousin from MP visited frequently but on his last visit, more than a decade ago, observed that no one in his host&#8217;s family got up for the early morning <i>namaz</i>, and that the women didn&#8217;t observe <i>purdah</i>. &#8220;You are too advanced for us; we practise Islam better in India.&#8221; That was the last time he heard from his cousin.\nIf Islamic Pakistan wasn&#8217;t the Promised Land for this man&#8217;s Indian relative, India too disappointed many Pakistani non-Muslims. Dai Solanki, a <i>panwali</i> outside Karachi&#8217;s ancient Neti Jeti temple, admitted that her relatives had gone to Ahmedabad but came back. &#8220;How long can others support us?&#8221; she asked. What about the fear of conversion? Bani, the old caretaker of the temple, snorted. &#8220;Convert us? They dare not.&#8221; The only trouble her family faced was after the Babri Masjid demolition, she said, when her home had been destroyed.

Bhikha Lakha Shiyal, 35, died on December 29, 2013 in a Karachi jail allegedly due to natural causes. However, his body has been kept at a mortuary in Karachi as a few formalities were yet to be completed by Pakistan and India.\n\n\n&#8220;Our Second Secretary in the Consular section is already in Karachi trying to speed up the process. He has not been handed over the body as of now,&#8221; an Indian diplomatic source told PTI.\n\n\nSources said if the body is handed over by Saturday, Indian authorities plan to send it on a Pakistan International Airlines flight the same day to Mumbai, from where it would be taken to Shiyal&#8217;s hometown in Gujarat. If for some reason the body is not handed over on Saturday, it is likely to be sent on the next PIA flight on Monday, the sources said. PIA is the only airline with direct flights between Indian and Pakistani cities. Earlier this month, another Indian fisherman Kishore Bhagwan was found dead under mysterious circumstances in Karachi&#8217;s Landhi jail. India had asked Pakistan last month to speed up the process of sending back Shiyal&#8217;s body. \n\nIndian sources in Karachi said that they learnt of Shiyal&#8217;s death only when the two countries exchanged lists of prisoners on January 1. The Pakistani list showed Shiyal as &#8220;dead.&#8221; &#8220;We immediately took up the matter and asked for documents from India to identify him. We confirmed his identity and wrote to Pakistan&#8217;s Foreign Office to speed up the process so that his body can be sent back to his family,&#8221; a source said.\n\n\nA reminder letter was also sent to Pakistani authorities to speed up the process, sources added.\n\n\nShiyal was arrested with several others by Pakistan&#8217;s Maritime Security Agency in the Arabian Sea on October 25 for straying into Pakistani waters. He died on December 19 in a Karachi jail. Shiyal, whose wife died about two years ago, is survived by his 15-year-old daughter and three-year-old son.\n\n\nA Rajya Sabha MP had written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take up with the Pakistan government the issue of bringing back the fisherman&#8217;s body.

But the recently launched talks between the Pakistan government and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan give rise to too many disquieting questions, including about the kind of peace Pakistan wants, and the Pakistani state&#8217;s vision of itself. After months of contradictory statements, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#8217;s acceptance of the TTP&#8217;s long-standing offer of talks came in the midst of a ruthless bombing campaign by the militants from Karachi to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and right after 20 soldiers were killed near the North Waziristan tribal area. Representatives of the two sides have already met once to plan a &#8220;roadmap&#8221; for the negotiations. The TTP is not participating directly, but through interlocutors in two of Pakistan&#8217;s Islamic parties, the Jamat-i-Islami and one faction of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, almost as if these were its political wing. One of the TTP&#8217;s negotiators is the former head of the Lal Masjid, the Islamabad mosque that under him became a terrorist stronghold. These representatives will be accountable to a 10-member Taliban committee. Through its own interlocutors, the government has said that talks must be held within the framework of the country&#8217;s Constitution and that their scope be limited to &#8220;insurgency-affected&#8221; areas. It wants the TTP to stop its terrorist attacks, and a time frame fixed for talks. It is yet not known if the Taliban and the government are on the same page on these points.\n\n\nThis is not the first time that Islamabad has tried to make peace with the militants. Every previous effort failed because the Taliban refused to submit to the state&#8217;s writ. Each time they came back stronger, their network of militancy in Pakistan expanding constantly, while the state&#8217;s own confusion on militancy and jihad helped Islamists occupy a large share of the national mindspace. It has come to a point where the Taliban now dictate terms, confident too with their brethren Taliban in Afghanistan on the ascendant. If Pakistan&#8217;s political leadership and its security establishment had at all absorbed the lessons of 2001, they would have been doing everything to prevent a repeat of history after the drawdown of foreign troops from Afghanistan. Instead, what appears to have trumped again is Pakistan&#8217;s desire for influence in Afghanistan, plus the delusion that it can somehow control the Taliban and other militants on both sides of the Durand Line. It is hard to escape the feeling that the region&#8217;s instability is going to get worse.

He filed a complaint against him before leaving for the Haj pilgrimage but it was Asghar who was arrested on his return. His crime was that he claimed to be the Holy Prophet and wrote letters in his name and even printed visiting cards, for which he was charged with blasphemy, a criminal offence punishable with death under Section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).\n\n\nWhile awarding the death sentence on January 23, 2014, the sessions court which conducted the trial in Adiala jail disregarded his extensive medical records from Scotland in which it is evident he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. An affidavit in June 2011 submitted to the court by Dr. Jane McLennan, a consultant psychiatrist of Royal Victoria Hospital in Edinburgh, where Asghar lived with his family, says that he was her patient in February and March 2010. Records showed that in 1993, he was first referred to psychiatric services and treated for depression. In 2000 he suffered a cerebrovascular stroke and as a result walked with a limp, needing the support of a walking stick. He also suffered from psychiatric symptoms after the stroke which included depression and delusionary beliefs of a paranoid and grandiose nature. He had auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions, believing that his home was bugged by the Pakistani and international media and that he was being persecuted for having written to Prime Minister Blair and President Bush, telling them the Iraq war was wrong, the affidavit said. \n\nHe was admitted to a psychiatric hospital on February 17, 2010, under an emergency detention certificate after expressing paranoid delusions regarding a Pakistani TV network and the police. He was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia by Dr. McLennan when he was admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital. She stressed that though he presented a good social facade, those without sufficient professional training might miss the indicators of his illness. This does not detract in any way from the severity of his illness or nullify the mental illness diagnosis, she said. He also had no insight into his illness and did not think he needed treatment and could not see his beliefs and actions were not rational.\n\n\nWhen he was discharged from hospital on March 18, 2010, he required vigorous and ongoing treatment as he remained mentally unwell. However, neither he nor his family had any insight into his mental illness and the need for treatment and neither he nor they engaged with ongoing treatment. When he was visited by his community psychiatric nurse in March 2010, he was clearly exhibiting symptoms of paranoid psychosis. Dr. McLennan said that it seems unlikely that Asghar continued with his medication after he travelled to Pakistan. Even during his time in the Scotland hospital, he often referred to himself as being a very holy man. &#8220;If his condition worsened, as it seems to have done, he may have described himself in more exaggerated terms, while not meaning to commit blasphemy,&#8221; she said.\n\n\nHe was receiving basic medication and his condition would deteriorate as long as he remained in prison, she pointed out in the affidavit. The probability of him attempting to take his own life is significant and may be increased if he remains in prison, she added, while recommending a comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation plan. Sure enough, Asghar tried to commit suicide on January 8, 2012 and had to be hospitalised. However, the trial court did not take evidence from the hospital into account, and a hastily summoned medical panel certified him as normal. His lawyers were thrown out in October 2013 and not allowed to be present when the verdict was pronounced.\n\n\nThere has been much outrage in the U.K. and elsewhere after this latest conviction. Under Section 295-C of the PPC &#8220;Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.&#8221; Asghar&#8217;s lawyers say that all the evidence against him was produced by the complainant in the form of letters and visiting cards in which he claimed to be the Holy Prophet. While an appeal against the conviction has been filed in the Islamabad High Court, there are serious concerns about his health after his lawyers finally managed to meet him in jail.\n\n\n<b>Other convictions</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the first case where a mentally ill person has been convicted for blasphemy. Two years ago, a mentally ill girl Rimsha Masih was sentenced to death for blasphemy but she was finally acquitted by the court in 2012 and granted asylum in Canada. Her fellow Christian neighbours were forced to flee their homes in Meherabad and live in precarious housing conditions in Islamabad. Rimsha&#8217;s persecutor, a cleric, was acquitted in 2013 of filing false charges.\n\n\nAasia Bibi, a Christian from the Punjab province, became the first woman in the country&#8217;s history to be sentenced to death for blasphemy in 2010, according to Human Rights Watch. In 2011, Punjab Governor Salman Taseer and former federal minister, a Roman Catholic, Shahbaz Bhatti were killed for anti-blasphemy law statements and for supporting Aasia Bibi who continues to languish in jail.

Former U.S. Ambassador Sherry Rehman faced threats after she proposed a bill banning the death penalty for blasphemy.\n\n\n<b>Targeting minorities</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to media reports, over 1,200 people have been charged with blasphemy from 1986 till 2010. The Human Rights Watch World Report 2014 says that abuses are rife under the country&#8217;s blasphemy law, which is used against religious minorities, often to settle personal disputes. Dozens of people were charged with the offence in 2013. At least 16 people remained on death row for blasphemy, while another 20 were serving life sentences.\n\n\nIn its State of Human Rights in 2012 report, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) says, &#8220;Abuse of the blasphemy law continues to take a heavy toll in terms of human lives and harassment of citizens. A well thought-out plan should be put into place to make the citizens aware of the havoc that the abuse of this law has caused and how important it is to insert safeguards that can prevent that abuse.&#8221; Sections 295 to 295-C of the PPC are generally referred to as the blasphemy code. The punishments for offences under these provisions include death (under Section 295-C), life imprisonment, imprisonment for various periods and a fine. Pakistan has not executed anyone under Section 295-C. However, many of the accused have been killed by extremists outside the courts or in prisons, according to the HRCP.\n\n\nSpeaking up against the blasphemy law often has fatal consequences and the few who do speak up, face death threats. With little chance of the law being amended, minorities and those who stand up for them continue to live on an unrelenting razor&#8217;s edge.\n\n\n<i><b>meena.menon@thehindu.co.in </b></i>\n', 'British,notorious,blasphemy,criminal,punishable,extensive,medical,evident,paranoid,psychiatric,cerebrovascular,psychiatric,delusionary,paranoid,international,wrong,psychiatric,paranoid,paranoid,good,social,professional,mental,hospital,vigorous,ongoing,mental,ongoing,psychiatric,paranoid,basic,own,significant,comprehensive,suicide,hospital,medical,present,much,visible,liable,complainant,serious,Other,first,ill,ill,precarious,cleric,Christian,first,former,federal,same,blasphemy,rife,religious,personal,heavy,human,important,various,many,fatal,few,', ' basic comprehensive good important significant vigorous', ' blasphemy criminal fatal ill liable notorious paranoid precarious punishable rife serious suicide wrong', 6, -13, -7, 19),

To indigenise this borrowed bit, the insides of the Sindh Festival&#8217;s &#8220;S&#8221; are filled in with burgundy and black in the traditional block print design of the Sindhi <i>ajrak </i>pattern. It is perhaps an apt pilfering; a superhero is indeed required to save the cultural heritage of Sindh, its languishing folk music, its shutdown art galleries, and its burnt down cinemas &#8212; all damning proof of a silenced cultural discourse.\nIf the Pakistan People&#8217;s Party (PPP) were to have its way, that hero, prescient and powerful, would be Mr. Bilawal Bhutto, the son of the slain Benazir Bhutto and Mr. Asif Zardari. If Superman&#8217;s &#8220;S&#8221; has been the letter dominating the festival, Mr. Bilawal Bhutto&#8217;s smiling face and stilted Urdu, sometimes flanked by one or both of his sisters, have reigned over its events. On February 1, 2014, at the inaugural ceremony of the two-week saga, beaming, smiling Bilawal, the author of so many brave, anti-extremist tweets, vowed to save Sindh&#8217;s culture against the obscurantism of the Taliban. Before an audience of hundreds, mostly political functionaries and friends and relatives of party leaders, his sister, Ms Bakhtawar sang a rap song in English. Its lyrics exhorted Pakistanis to &#8220;stand tall&#8221; on &#8220;their soil with pride.&#8221;\nThe stage on which the Bhutto children stood, as also the soil on which it had been erected to showcase their efforts at cultural regeneration, has a story. In the darkness behind the stage stood the 3,000-year-old &#8220;Mound of the Dead,&#8221; the iconic centre of the ancient city of Moenjodaro. In past years, this remnant of the Indus Valley civilization has been the site of just neglect and disrepair. \nNone of that is surprising in a country where history has been the handmaiden of the political ambitions of this or that ruler; the ruins of Moenjodaro have not added much to most strategic calculations. The dust has blown across its desolate mud buildings, the water table has risen, threatening the excavations, and the delicate mud bricks from which the inhabitants wrought their dwellings have begun to erode.\nThis has been the story until now. Sometime late last year, the leadership of the PPP, which controls the government of Sindh, decided that the inauguration ceremony for the festival must be held in Moenjodaro itself, and its proceedings undertaken on a stage directly in front of the historic &#8220;Mound of the Dead.&#8221; Against this decision no opposition could stand. It did not matter that the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared such a construction, of the stage, so close to the Mound excavation an &#8220;improper activity&#8221; that threatened the universal value of the archaeological site. It mattered even less that conservationists at the Department of Museums and Archaeology reminded the Sindh government officials that the Antiquities Act of 1975 prohibits any human activity within 200 feet of any national heritage.\nThe massive stage was thus constructed in the middle of Moenjodaro and with the old Mound as its photographic backdrop. Hundreds of workers, more than the site has ever had for its preservation or excavation, drilled and dug and dragged. They bought electric poles, wooden platforms and plastic chairs and all the other trappings needed to hold a grand event of unprecedented cultural regeneration. On Twitter, the superhero under construction, Mr. Bilawal Bhutto, gathered volunteers, saying, &#8220;If u would like 2 volunteer 2 help me preserve, protect &amp; promote Sindh&#8217;s heritage email festivalsindh@gmail.com&#8221;. \nIn a letter, the UNESCO representative, Kozue Nagata, made a last-ditch effort on behalf of maimed Moenjodaro: &#8220;We appreciate the effort to revitalise the long-lost culture,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but it should not be done at the cost of destroying the ruins and structure of the site.&#8221; Sadly, the resuscitators of culture were too busy to listen.\nCulture and context are wed, and in Pakistan, the context is one of a rabid ravaging of all forms of cultural expression. The blasting of Buddhas, the bombing of Sufi shrines, and the banning of representational art and music are all mainstays in the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan&#8217;s arsenal of terror. In killing-laden Karachi, 400 kilometres from Moenjodaro, the Taliban have killed a hundred people in blasts, murders and shootings in the single month of January. Beginning February with music and dance, the sale of artefacts and the display of tradition seems commendable. So it would be, were it not for the details of destruction wrought within it.\nThe brash and unthinking endangerment of antiquity on the altars of cultural resistance against the Taliban is a fine illustration of the country&#8217;s conundrums. If the forms of resuscitation were sowed in democratic groundswell and provided opportunity for political expression to the millions of Pakistani youth and not simply the scions of feudal families, they would represent an authentic and widely relevant oppositional discourse against the Taliban, one that is desperately needed. Like the stage erected for the Sindh Cultural Festival, built such that it destroys the very heritage it seeks to protect, the PPP-led effort to inaugurate and foment a form of cultural resistance has become instead the hollow manipulation of a cultural cataclysm for the launch of the next generation of Bhutto heirs.\n<i>(Rafia Zakaria is the author of the forthcoming </i>The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan.<i>)</i>', 'familiar,black,traditional,ajrak,cultural,cultural,prescient,powerful,inaugural,many,political,cultural,iconic,ancient,site,neglect,political,strategic,last,historic,such,archaeological,human,national,massive,old,photographic,electric,wooden,plastic,other,cultural,busy,cultural,representational,music,arsenal,single,music,cultural,democratic,political,feudal,authentic,relevant,oppositional,such,very,cultural,cultural,next,forthcoming,', ' authentic democratic historic powerful relevant traditional', ' black busy neglect', 6, -3, 3, 9),

Is there a hierarchy or chain of command between these two, or are both two different organisations with different objectives, ideologies and targets? Is there a communication link between the two leaderships in terms of operational activities, or are they more of a rhetoric?\nThe more one analyses the linkages between the Afghan Taliban and the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the more differences one could trace between the two organisations &#8212; in terms of history, objectives, ideology and operational targets.\nGiven the lack of documentational support and evidence, along with interviews with the top leadership on both sides, most of the understanding will have to be conjectures based on an informed guess. A larger debate is needed on this subject.\nThere are adequate writings and historical accounts of the Afghan Taliban; from Ahmed Rashid&#8217;s magnum opus on the Taliban, to multiple publications during the last decade, there is a clear historical account of how Mullah Omar from a <i>madrasa </i>in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) ended up becoming the Amir of Afghanistan.\nThe Afghan Taliban was founded and supported by Pakistan in the 1990s to achieve a particular objective in Kabul. To use Admiral Mike Mullen&#8217;s proposition much later, the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s was a veritable arm of Pakistan &#8212; both the political leadership and the military establishment. There is adequate literature available today explaining why Pakistan founded and supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s. Of course it was not referred to as the &#8220;Afghan&#8221; Taliban then; it was just the Taliban. The founders of the Taliban would have never expected or even dreamt that there would be a parallel organisation east of the Durand Line within Pakistan.\nThe TTP, referred to loosely as the Pakistani Taliban, came into being in 2007 with its headquarters in Waziristan. But who founded it and who supported it? More importantly, for what reasons?\nThe Pakistani Taliban was certainly not founded by the security establishment in Pakistan, which was responsible for the birth of the Afghan Taliban. Ironically, the TTP was founded to fight the Pakistani establishment. This could be seen from a series of attacks that the TTP carried out; from suicide attacks to high profile attacks on military targets in Rawalpindi, Karachi and elsewhere, one could easily conclude that the primary target of the TTP remains Pakistan.\nGiven the targets and the time span that the TTP is a post-2007 phenomenon, it would be safe to conclude that the Pakistani Taliban was established by the al-Qaeda, rather than Mullah Omar. Though the initial leadership of the TTP, especially Baitullah Mehsud, claimed Mullah Omar as his leader, in operational aspects he was supported by the al-Qaeda network such as the Uzbeks, rather than the Afghan Taliban.\nEver since the Taliban and al-Qaeda leadership and base shifted into Pakistan after international troops landed in Afghanistan, there was much pressure on Gen. Musharraf to go against the militants in Pakistan, who were using the FATA as a base to carry out operations against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). While Gen. Musharraf faced serious pressure and at times even sanctions and threats from the U.S. to do more, there was also equal resistance from his own establishment to going against &#8220;their boys.&#8221; How can they, for they are seen as their trump card in Afghanistan?\nAs a result, Pakistan was selective in apprehending and neutralising the militants on its soil. More al-Qaeda leaders were either captured and handed over, or neutralised. Even today, Pakistan is more than willing to sacrifice the al-Qaeda leadership, but not the Afghan Taliban. There is enough literature available on the number of al-Qaeda leaders either captured and handed over to the U.S. silently by Pakistan <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the Afghan Taliban. The establishment of the TTP should be interpreted in this background; it was more a creation of the al-Qaeda than that of the Afghan Taliban under Mullah Omar. The U.S. should be aware of this, and is perhaps willing to live with this; it is no coincidence that the drone attacks have targeted more of the al-Qaeda and TTP leadership in Pakistan, but not the Afghan Taliban!\nThere appears a clear divide between the two, in terms of operational areas and targets. The Afghan Taliban &#8212; led by the Quetta Shura (of Mullah Omar) and the Haqqani network, in spite of having their bases in Pakistan (in Balochistan and FATA respectively), target primarily the Karzai government and international security forces in Afghanistan. There have been no major operations by these groups against the Pakistani establishment east of the Durand Line. Nor have there been any major statements or threats. Perhaps, that is why the government and military in Pakistan do not see the Afghan Taliban as a threat.\nOn the other hand, the TTP has been continuously targeting the government, society and military within Pakistan. Except for Mullah Fazlullah&#8217;s faction, referred to more as the Swat Taliban, and its earlier avatar &#8212; the TNSM (Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi) established by Sufi Muhammad (Fazlullah&#8217;s father-in-law), the Pakistani Taliban, especially those factions under the leadership of the Mehsuds (both Baitullah and Hakimullah) did not fight much in Afghanistan; they always targeted Pakistan and operated within the country.\nIn terms of links between the leadership, though the Pakistani Taliban claimed Mullah Omar as its leader, it was more rhetoric. In reality, it was led by the Mehsuds in Waziristan aided by a Shura, rather than &#8220;commanded&#8221; by Mullah Omar. In fact, the Pakistani Taliban is not a monolithic organisation; it has evolved into a franchisee, with the Mehsuds as the core in Waziristan along with the Swat Taliban, Bajaur Taliban and later, even a Punjabi Taliban.\nThe larger question today would be, are the linkages between the two groups likely to change in 2014, with the withdrawal deadline in Afghanistan, and the change in the TTP leadership from the Mehsud tribes in Waziristan to Mullah Fazlullah in Swat? We need a larger debate on and analysis of how the linkages between the two are likely to change in 2014.\n<i>(D.

Such a thing would be unthinkable now, he grins. At 80, he is president of the Awami Workers Party (AWP), formed after a merger of three Left parties in 2012 which plans to hold a congress in March. There is a renewed attempt to forge a clearly defined Left in Pakistan, he says.\nWriting in <i>The News</i>, Sarah Humayun says, &#8220;the left has lost visibility in the public space; in this respect, it has fared even worse than the NGOs, whose liberal pro-civil-society thought has been similarly assimilated without increasing the appeal of liberal thinking as such in the public space.&#8221; The Left in Pakistan was scattered after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and the resurgence of the global corporate system in the shape of the New World, Mr. Minto says. Pakistan was badly affected by the disarray of the Left especially since its trade union movement was weak, resulting in many factions. Trying to regroup, the key question is: what kind of politics has the Left to come up with to deal with new challenges in Pakistan where many things haven&#8217;t changed at all? It also wants a distinct identity from the liberals, who hail from a class not interested in social change, according to Aasim Sajjad, secretary general of the AWP, Punjab. &#8220;Activism alone won&#8217;t help us consolidate or add up to a coherent movement. Something beyond activism needs to happen and we are trying to bring all the left groups together,&#8221; he points out.\nFor the AWP, the challenge is mainly to create an alternative to the neo-liberal economic system. Opting for a social democratic method is the only way out for the new party. For the three parties in the merger, there was no choice but to revert to the principles enunciated in Left/Marxist politics and they have to be adopted to the changing situation, Mr. Minto says. Departing from the earlier internationalist politics which split the Communists between China and the Soviets, the new party has decided to stick to anti- imperialism and anti-colonialism in some manner and formulate a joint programme on Marxist principles at the congress.\nWhile peasant communities organised in the mid-20th century, and there were some reforms, the ban in 1954 of the Communist Party and its affiliated unions put an end to further struggles. The Left was more of a talking and debating group than a political group. There is uncertainty if the Left in a classical fashion will be able to tackle new liberal politics. There is an understanding that it needs a new identity which forges links with anti-Taliban and anti-fundamentalist forces.\nIn the past, the Left had its students, peasant and trade union federations plus the Progressive Writers Association. The AWP feels there is a critical mass for the Left to grow in Pakistan and this could be due to the joint impact of Taliban terror and the onslaught of the middle classes coming up as the partner of the political system. The Communist Party of Pakistan was formed in 1948 at the Calcutta Congress when it was decided to have a separate party. Even at its peak, it had 650 or so members, the cardholders &#8212; the numbers were small but the politics was clear, they were committed to Marxism as a gospel, Mr. Minto says. When writer Noor Zaheer visited Pakistan recently, people called her Comrade Noor, in memory of her late father, Sajjad Zaheer who headed the party before it was banned.\nMs Zaheer says what is most needed now is for splinter groups not only in Pakistan but all over South Asia to come together and challenge the religious and other right-wing forces. Her father had left behind a legacy which should be taken forward, and there&#8217;s a lot left to be done, she feels.\nHowever, there is scepticism about the AWP. Critics like Fayyaz Baqir, director of the Akhter Hameed Khan Resource Centre, who was in Left student politics in the 1960s point out that the strength of the Communists was in their strong literary and artistic agenda. Right from the beginning, the serious shortcoming which persists till today is that they had no understanding of Pakistan society. They were divided between pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese and had no analysis of the class structures or class interests and the way the state or the political system worked. Also, they didn&#8217;t have an understanding of mass politics. As a result, when the Pakistan People&#8217;s Party was formed with many elements from the Left, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto captured power. The Communists didn&#8217;t produce mass leaders and they didn&#8217;t produce non-traditional intellectuals, he says.\nThe Left lacked an understanding of religion and they can&#8217;t blame problems only on religious leaders, he says. When Baqir joined the Nationalist Students Organization at 18, he thought that scientific socialism was the tool to ignite every heart. In no time, millions of people would be following them and the system could be overthrown. &#8220;We are not ready to accept that the world which existed in our dreams is not relevant anymore; we need different dreams,&#8221; he adds.\nAccepting that there was need for a solid intellectual analysis of Pakistani society, Mr. Sajjad says the collapse of the Left eroded its organisational capacity and the people who stayed on were very junior and were pushed to the top. Even the old assembly lines like students&#8217; unions and study circles had stopped and subsequent efforts were made to keep the flag flying. There was lot of dynamism but no real regeneration in terms of a cadre of younger activists. It will take a long time to build a cadre to replace the old one. A lot of impetus is coming from the younger cadre which doesn&#8217;t have the baggage of the Cold War demons, he feels.\nThe difficulty now is in raising a cadre of younger people. With the banning of students&#8217; unions in the Zia-ul-Haq regime, there is no politics on campus. Students have to sign an affidavit which says that they will not partake in any political activity against the administration. The National Students&#8217; Federation (NSF), the oldest left-wing organisation, is trying to revive unions but getting students to take an interest especially in the Punjab is difficult. Alia Amirali, general secretary, NSF, in Punjab, says the first task is to educate people on what a union is and how it&#8217;s different from a non-political organisation which is allowed on campus. Students are worried about getting into the NSF &#8212; they fear jails and court cases and there is an antipathy to mainstream politics in Punjab as opposed to Balochistan where the students&#8217; movement has fed so many political groups or in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThe Left, despite all its restrictions and bans, did have an influence on thinking but if it has to grow, it has to have a more inclusive approach, says Nasreen Azhar, member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. There is also a realisation that while the Left can be effective despite the small numbers, as it was during the Lawyers&#8217; movement, it ended up having more of a discursive impact. But, as Mr. Sajjad says, the Left is sorely needed for a third perspective &#8212; ideologically, society shifted to the right and no one is talking of class, gender or social cleavages in society. The challenge for the new party then is to make inroads into politics which is vitiated by terrorism and dominated by the right wing, and to inspire confidence in a more progressive and egalitarian stream of thinking.\n<i>meena.menon@thehindu.co.in </i>', 'first,multinational,unthinkable,liberal,liberal,such,global,corporate,weak,many,key,new,many,distinct,interested,social,secretary,general,alternative,economic,social,democratic,only,new,new,joint,political,classical,able,new,liberal,new,past,peasant,critical,due,joint,political,separate,small,clear,late,religious,other,strong,literary,artistic,serious,political,many,blame,religious,scientific,ready,relevant,different,solid,intellectual,organisational,junior,old,subsequent,real,long,old,political,general,first,different,antipathy,many,political,inclusive,effective,small,discursive,third,perspective,social,new,progressive,egalitarian,', ' able democratic distinct effective egalitarian inclusive interested liberal progressive ready real relevant solid strong', ' antipathy blame serious unthinkable weak', 14, -5, 9, 19),

The institute instead suggested that she take private lessons as the families of other students would object to her presence.\n\n\nMs Khan, who works for the Gender Interactive Alliance, was in tears as she narrated the incident at a workshop on Monday, organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI). &#8220;I am educated. I have a double M.A., yet this is how I was treated,&#8221; she said. \n\nMs Khan is among the three members of the transgender community &#8211; the other two being Mazhar Anjum and Muskan &#8211; who, in an unprecedented step, were offered jobs by the Sindh government a few days ago. \n\n<b>Vocational training</b>\n\n\nThe government is also organising a vocational training workshop for the transgender community on February 20.\n\n\nThe Gender Interactive Alliance has demanded that a member of the community be nominated to provincial assemblies. \n\nDespite a landmark Supreme Court judgment that recognised the transgenders&#8217; right to equality and inheritance, and their right to be registered as the third gender or &#8220;khwaja seras&#8221; in the National Database and Registration Authority, the community faces discrimination.\n\n\nMuhammad Majid Bashir, a senior advocate, said the landmark 2011 verdict allowed a third gender category on national identity cards, gave transgenders a legal share in family inheritance, reserved two per cent quota in jobs in all sectors and gave them the right to vote in the elections. \n\nBut as Almas Boby of the Transgender Foundation pointed out, the biggest issue for the community is social acceptance. She could not study beyond matriculation due to social pressure. \n\nHowever, separate schools for transgenders will isolate the community further, she said. &#8220;Please accept us and let us be part of society.&#8221;\n\n\n<b>Family support crucial</b>\n\n\nMs Khan said families should support children who have a different sexual orientation. Her family supported her which is why she could study. But many families disowned their children who had no option but to beg or dance for a livelihood, she lamented. \n\nJannat Ali, who has an MBA and heads the Khwaja Sera Society, runs a literary project which imparts teaching skills to young people so that they don&#8217;t have to beg on the streets. She says it is difficult for transgenders to continue schooling, thanks to the social attitude &#8211; children are taunted and many are reluctant to go to school. \n\nThe access of the community to health care is a challenge too, said Ms Khan. &#8220;We are not even allowed to stand in queues, how can we get treatment?&#8221; \n\nFor the 1.5 million transgender community, social acceptance is certainly a long way off.

Apart from Mr. Khan, the TTP had named Maulana Samiul Haq, Malulana Aziz, the former chief cleric of the Lal Masjid; Professor Mohammad Ibrahim of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI); and Mufti Kifayatullah, of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) to hold talks with government negotiators.\nHowever, JUI-F head Maulana Fazlur Rehman said he would not be part of the dialogue process as his party was not taken into confidence. He also said his party&#8217;s nominee Mufti Kifayatullah was bound to toe the party line of not being part of the talks.\nSignificantly, the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Mr. Richard Olson called on the Federal Minister for Interior and Narcotics Control, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Monday to discuss issues pertaining to bilateral relations with particular reference to the security situation in the region.\nAccording to an official statement, Mr. Chaudhry Nisar said that Pakistan wants to further strengthen its relations with the U.S. based on mutual trust and transparency.

In the years since, though, he became one of the architects of the new Afghanistan that emerged, serving as its Foreign Minister. Later, however, he fell out with President Hamid Karzai and has emerged as a key opposition leader. In the 2009 elections, characterised by large-scale malpractice, Mr. Abdullah came in second. This time around, he hopes to the front runner, though some commentators believe the perception that he is not Pashtun &#8212; he is in fact of mixed Pashtun and Tajik heritage &#8212; will cost him votes in an ethnically-divided society. Excerpts from an interview given to <b>Praveen Swami</b>, where Mr. Abdullah spoke on his assessments of the prospects for Afghanistan&#8217;s upcoming elections. </i>\n\n\n<b>Looking at events as they are unfolding, are you confident presidential elections will be held in 2014, and how confident are you they will be fair? </b>\n\nThe concerns are there; they are real. The first priority is that elections be held on time, in the early months of 2014. There is no doubt they will be very different elections. The security situation, of course, is one obvious concern. Then, there is the fact that large parts of the country will still be in the grip of winter when elections are held. Finally, the kinds of electoral reforms we had hoped for have not occurred. We hope, though, that the electoral bodies, and the Electoral Complaints Commission, understand how enormous their responsibilities are. This is not just an election to choose a President, but to build a democratic Afghanistan. \n\n<b>The pre-election situation will obviously become more complicated if the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) with the United States is not signed soon. There are even fears that the International Security Assistance Force may then pull out before the elections, and that western aid might be cut sharply. </b>\n\n\nWhatever President Karzai&#8217;s reasons are for not signing the BSA &#8212; and I think they are not the stated reasons, but personal ones, which I do not want to go into &#8212; I do not feel what he is doing is in the interests of the country. Let us face it: there is no ideal agreement that will satisfy all the desires of the Afghan people, and there will not be an ideal agreement tomorrow. To say, as President Karzai is saying, &#8216;let the United States bring peace today and we will sign&#8217; is meaningless. The negotiations were done; a text agreed on. To question the merit of signing it now will obviously generate a lot of concern, and the Afghan people are paying the costs. Food and fuel prices have shot up on panic buying. The little money investors were bringing in has been put on hold. Now, because this element of uncertainty about the post-2014 situation has been gratuitously injected on this situation, there is even volatility. \n\n<b>There have been some fears that in addition to all these problems, ethnic tensions are mounting, and that the election may end up contributing to the fragmentation of the nation. Do you share these concerns? </b>\n\n\nThere are some people who want exactly this to happen. There are people who are instigating violence through hate speech, which inevitably provokes a response, pre-planned or spontaneous. I am not, however, concerned about the people. Afghans have learned that national unity is the key to our survival. So, while there are efforts to incite tensions, I think there is also a deep wisdom among the people, which will prevail. \n\n<b>A year ago, there were hopes that the election process would become more inclusive with the reconciliation process, which hoped to bring the Taliban, or a section of them, on board. Is there still any life in these hopes? </b>\n\n\nWhatever our desires or wishes might be, I do not see that the elements are there to make peace with the Taliban. While we should keep doing whatever is needed to work towards peace, realistically, the prospects of the desired outcome are not high. \n\n<b>Do you think, therefore, the election will be marred by violence? There are all kinds of conflicting reports on the reach of the Taliban. </b>\n\n\nIt is how you look at these reports &#8212; the truth is that there are improvements in the security situation in some areas, and setbacks in others. I should candidly say that, yes, there are risks. It would be highly misleading if we say there is no security risk to the elections. Hopefully, though, with the joint efforts of the Afghan security forces and the people, we can have a good election. \n\n<b>Finally, in your view, is greater Indian involvement in Afghanistan something that is desirable, or does it hinder things by getting Pakistan&#8217;s back up? </b>\n\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#8217;s government has sent the right signals and used the right words. I&#8217;m not going to be quick to judge though about what this means, but it is always good to hope for the best. Now, I think it is in Pakistan&#8217;s best interests to help stabilise the situation in Afghanistan. They cannot, for this, claim a veto over Afghanistan&#8217;s relationship with India. It is for Afghanistan and India to decide what their relationship should be like.

This plea was not maintainable before this court because the jurisdiction of the special court is confined within the limits prescribed under the High Treason(Punishment) act 1973 and the Criminal law amendment act, the order said. \n\nThough the special court has three judges of the high court, it does not possess powers of judicial review or administrative action available to the high court. The court said Musharraf''s name was on the Exit Control List and the Sindh high court in an order of December 23, 2013 had declined to take his name off the list.\n\n\nThe order said that on the grounds of security concerns and illness it had exempted Musharraf in the past. However, the court had asked a medical board comprising AFIC to answer three questions relating to Musharraf''s health. Though the report didn''t provide question wise answers, the court quoted the report which indicated the state of his health. \n\nMusharraf was admitted to AFIC on January 2 when he developed a heart problem en route the court. The court said it examined the medical report at face value and in its considered opinion, it did not suggest that the accused in his present state of health needs to remain confined and is not allowed movement of any nature that prevents him from appearing in court. \n\nIn the absence of any such restriction imposed by the doctors, there is no reasonable excuse to justify the failure of the accused to appear in the court. The doctors have not found it appropriate to place any restrictions on the accused and no such advice was given, the order said.\n\n\nMusharraf is in hospital for a month now and so far he has not undergone coronary angiography and AFIC claims it has state of the art facilities with highly qualified specialists and is also ISO certified. It performs 1600 surgeries a year of which 80 per cent are open heart surgeries, the order said adding that the court did not find anything inappropriate in the medical report and therefore did not address the objections raised by the prosecution. \n\nLawyers for Musharraf, Mohammed Ali Saif and Faisal Hussain told reporters that the court had found the medical report appropriate.

Faisal Hussain advocate in the team of lawyers led by Sharifuddin Pirzada for Musharraf, said that the Supreme Court did not find this case appropriate for review like they did when they entertained Mr. Nawaz Sharif''s case after eight years. \n\nThe review petition filed last December, said that the findings of the Supreme court order in the Sindh High Court Bar Association case were prejudicial to the special court which was trying Musharraf for high treason. \n\nThe former President was never heard or represented in court, Mr. Hussain pointed out. It was illegal and against the principles of natural justice to pass orders without hearing a person and a violation of federal law. \n\nBasically the review petition wanted the apex court to revisit its own judgement.

Mr. Gul said Asghar had come to Pakistan in 2010 and he was accused of printing visiting cards in the name of the Prophet Mohammed. Police had also seized some letters he had written where he wrote that he was the Prophet. Handwriting experts had testified in court that the letters were written by Asghar. \n\nWhen asked to say something in his defence, Asghar confessed he was indeed the Holy Prophet, Mr. Gul pointed out. \n\nThe additional sessions judge had also constituted a medical board to evaluate his mental health and the board had said that he was not insane and in perfect health, he added. Under section 295 C of the Pakistan Penal Code &#8220;Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.&#8221; \n\nHowever, his legal representatives who were thrown out of the case in October 2013, said that Asghar had a long and well diagnosed history of mental illness starting from 1993. He had also suffered a stroke in 2000 and walked with a limp. They are going in appeal against the sentence in the high court. \n\nA resident of Edinburgh, Scotland, he was detained under the Mental Health Act in February 2010 for suffering from paranoid delusions and later admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital. It was diagnosed that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. He was later released into the care of his family, subject to visits by social health workers who reported that he was not taking his medication. Neither he nor his family had an insight to his illness and the need for medication and care. \n\nHe decided to return to Rawalpindi where he owned two properties but he found that one of them was being occupied by the complainant, Hafeez Awan, who is alleged to be a member of the land mafia and has several anti-corruption cases against him, the legal representatives said. \n\nAsghar filed a complaint against Awan and then left for Haj. On his return in September, he was arrested on blasphemy charges and all the evidence including the letters, was handed over to the police by the complainant. His defence lawyers obtained his medical records in March 2011 from the National Health Service in the UK and an affidavit from the consultant psychiatrist at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Edinburgh. \n\nThe legal team then filed all the documents in court and said Asghar was not fit to face trial. The judge had then ordered for a medical evaluation. On January 8, 2012, Asghar attempted suicide and was admitted to the GHQ hospital in Rawalpindi. The legal representatives said that they had alerted the jail authorities of a possibility of suicide which is not uncommon among cases of paranoid schizophrenia. \n\nNo steps were taken and he developed acute respiratory distress and was kept in the critical care unit for several days. While he was recovering, a hastily constituted medical board with one psychiatrist was sent to evaluate him in hospital. The doctors received threatening calls and the hospital wanted to send Asghar back to jail. \n\nThe medical report said he suffered from &#8220;major organic affective depression.&#8221; By then the judge had changed and he did not hear the evidence, his legal representatives said.

The doctor was part of a polio drive but allegedly helped the CIA track down Osama Bin Laden and has been in jail since 2011.\nIn response to a question at the weekly media briefing on the stand of the government after the U.S. said it would hold back $ 33 million till the release of Dr Afridi, Â spokesperson Ms Tasnim Aslam said that the matter is sub-judice. If the courts exonerated him that would be a different matter but he has been convicted and the review process is taking place, she said.\nShe also clarified that the entire allocation for Pakistan is not linked to Dr. Afridi&#8217;s detention and only $ 33 million dollars was linked. Earlier, a statement issued by the spokesperson on Monday expressed disappointment that the Consolidated Appropriations Â Bill 2014, approved by US Congress which was signed into law by the President on January, 17, Â 2014 proposes to withhold US$ 33 million from assistance on account of Dr. Afridi&#8217;s detention. The statement said that Dr. Afridi, a citizen of Pakistan, is accused of having violated the country&#8217;s laws. His action also caused immense damage to the polio campaign in the country. His case is sub judice and he remains entitled to due process under the law. Consequently, any linkage of U.S. assistance to this case is not in keeping with the spirit of cooperation between the two countries.\nShe also said that the issue of funding and Dr Afridi&#8217;s detention could figure in the review of the Strategic Dialogue between the U.S. and Pakistan next week.\nIn November 2013, Dr Afridi whose 33- year- old sentence on charges of being linked with a banned terror organization was overturned, was slapped with a charge of murder in Khyber Agency for the death of a\nboy in 2006-07 during a surgery. The case was registered by the Khyber agency administration over an incident which happened some years ago when he was practicing at a government run hospital in Bara in Khyber\nAgency. Even after his sentence was overturned Dr Afridi continues to be lodged in Peshawar jail. On August 29 the Frontier Crimes Regulation commissioner in Peshawar Sahebzada Anees ur Rehman who later died in a mysterious fire in Islamabad in October, had set aside the trial and sentencing of Dr Afridi.\nIn December 2013, a tribunal of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in Peshawar disposed of a review petition filed by Dr Afridi seeking a trial by a sessions judge.\nThe three- member tribunal which reviewed the case asked the FCR commissioner to clarify his predecessor&#8217;s order. The tribunal held that the Commissioner in his order in August overturning the sentence\nwas ambiguous about who should conduct a fresh trial in the case and sought clarity on whether it should be by a political agent or a sessions judge.', 'weekly,different,entire,due,next,old,later,mysterious,tribunal,tribunal,tribunal,ambiguous,fresh,political,', ' fresh', ' ambiguous mysterious', 1, -2, -1, 3),

The spate of bombings targeting the security forces and the police, and the blast near the military General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, a day after the suicide attack in the Bannu cantonment, are too close for comfort. Every attack has been claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), with which the government was mandated to have a dialogue for peace by the All Parties Conference (APC), at its meeting on September 9, 2013.\n Within two months of the APC, on November 1, 2013, TTP chief Hakimullah Mehsud was killed by a drone strike and the Minister for Interior, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, slammed the United States for sabotaging the peace process. He said at a well attended press conference the next day that ties with the U.S. would be reviewed. Some interlocutors had been about to fly to meet Mehsud with a formal invite for talks with the government, he said. Even before that, a week after the APC , militants killed two army officers in Upper Dir, and followed it up with week-long bomb attacks in Peshawar, including an attack on a church that killed over 80 people.\nThe TTP&#8217;s new leader Mullah Fazlullah has refused to talk to the government, if the militant outfit&#8217;s publicists are to be believed. The outfit&#8217;s recent attacks have not spared even the media. Last week, the TTP brazenly called up a television channel whose staffers it killed in an attack in Karachi to claim responsibility.\nBlasts are occurring with unfailing regularity and the government which is putting together a draft National Security Policy can only react in shock and condemnation. The policy envisages a military operation against militants as the last option. At the APC, outgoing army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, was also on the same page as the government on the need for a dialogue. The government keeps saying the army is on the same page even now, despite the constant targeting of security forces. However, there are targeted operations as in December when the security forces killed over 20 militants in North Waziristan after an army checkpost was bombed. After the Bannu attack, the army used air strikes to hit suspected militant hideouts in North Waziristan, which killed 40 terrorists, including top Taliban leaders.\nThe TTP is putting out conflicting statements, calling for a ceasefire first from the government side and clearly not favouring a dialogue on its avowed aim of spreading the Sharia law across Pakistan. Mr. Chaudhry Nisar, responding to the Bannu Cantonment bombing which claimed the lives of over 20 Frontier Corps men, said the government was in favour of a dialogue with those who believed in peace but it could take action against those who believed in bloodshed. \nFor some time now, Islamabad has been trying to make a distinction between those elements in Pakistan Taliban that favour a dialogue and those that are unrelenting in their violent quest. It brackets the two late TTP leaders, Wali ur Rehman and Hakimullah Mehsud, as those who favoured a dialogue which couldn&#8217;t take off due to their deaths. The government is under tremendous pressure to initiate action but can it negotiate for peace from a position of strength? What are the issues it will take to the table for the talks? The TTP, as the government says, has over 50 factions, making a dialogue difficult.\nThe unseen enemy which operates from the shadows, as the Interior Minister described the TTP, is clearly calling the shots for now. \nThe Opposition parties, including a vociferous Imran Khan, leader of the Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI), have been questioning the dialogue process. How can talks fail when they didn&#8217;t take off to begin with, Mr. Khan asked. In Parliament, politicians have repeatedly demanded updates on the talks from the government and the response has left them far from satisfied.\nExternally too, Pakistan is under fire for not clamping down on cross-border terrorism, and not curbing the Haqqani network which is engaged in fighting in Afghanistan, something the U.S. has pointed out time and again. It did not help matters that a senior financier of the Haqqani network, Naseeruddin Haqqani, was shot dead in the capital city some time ago.\nPresident Barack Obama signed a bill last week which clearly linked funding to Pakistan&#8217;s actions on terrorism and the release of Dr. Shakil Afridi who is in jail for helping the CIA track down Osama bin Laden in 2011. There are provisions to withhold $33 million unless Dr. Afridi is released and cleared of all charges.\nAnother provision can block aid until Secretary of State John Kerry certifies that Pakistan is not supporting terrorist activities against the U.S. or the coalition forces in Afghanistan. A key element of the bill is Pakistan&#8217;s cooperation with the U.S. to deal with counter terrorism efforts against the Haqqani network and other terror groups, and preventing them from operating from Pakistan.\nPakistan has already reacted with disappointment to the withholding of funds over Dr. Afridi&#8217;s release. But the other issues related to preventing cross-border terrorism are equally vital.

As in 2012, 61 per cent of the total 1,717 terrorist attacks were carried out by the Pakistani Taliban, mainly the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and affiliated groups in which 1,418 people were killed and 3,408 injured. The Baloch and Sindhi nationalists carried out 450 attacks killing 375 people and injuring 835. \nThe TTP was lethal with 645 attacks in 50 districts, killing 732 civilians and 425 security forces personnel. The militant outfit also claimed responsibility or was reportedly involved in 34 suicide attacks out of 46.\nThe number of suicide attacks rose by 39 per cent with 46 suicide attacks in 2013 compared to 33 in 2012, 18 of them in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 12 in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), nine in Balochistan and five in Sindh. Thirty-four suicide attacks were by the TTP and nine by the Lashkar-e-Janghvi.\nAs many as 498 of the total terrorist attacks were aimed at security personnel, convoys and check-posts and 358 attacks were apparently aimed at civilians. About 212 were sectarian, targeting places of worship, shrines and 198 attacks targeted political leaders, parties and rallies.\nThere were 78 attacks on educational institutions and 50 on NATO supply trucks and 25 on NGO, civil society members including polio vaccination teams. Journalists, minority communities, and diplomats were also targeted by terrorists.\nThe report says significant attack tactics used by terrorists in 2013 included improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in 710 attacks, grenades in 122 incidents, rocket attacks -108, sabotage -18, kidnapping-16, beheadings-five, mortar fire-4 and petrol bomb in two cases. In 208 sectarian attacks by banned groups and the TTP, 658 people lost their lives while over 1000 were injured.\nThe highest number of terrorist attacks- 499 for any one region was reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which also witnessed a rise in sectarian violence killing 706 people. Balochistan was the worst affected by terrorism with 727 deaths in 487 terrorist attacks. Karachi which had one of the worst years in terms of violence, reported 356 terrorist attacks in which 492 were killed while FATA with 293 attacks accounted for 425 deaths.\nOverall the country reported 2555 incidents of violence including the terrorist attacks and a total of 4725 were killed with 6932 injured. Violence in the Punjab increased by 123 per cent in 2013, as compared to 2012 while Karachi witnessed a 90 per cent increase. There was a rise of 81 per cent in the number of people killed in 2013 in Karachi. The number of cross-border attacks and clashes increased in 2013 particularly along the Pakistan India border (including the Line of Control and the working Boundary) but the casualties in these attacks decreased, the report said. Most of the cross-border attacks and clashes (66 per cent) were reported from Pakistan&#8217;s border with India. About 26 clashes and nine attacks were reported from Pakistan&#8217;s border with Afghanistan, India and Iran which was 30 per cent more than in 2012.

Gen. Khalid Ahmed Kidwai, whose name had become virtually synonymous with the nuclear weapons and strategy management of the country. He was replaced by Lt. Gen. Zubair Mahmood Hayat, corps commander Bahawalpur in one of the quieter moves by the Nawaz Sharif government, which has renewed the debate on the safety of Pakistan&#8217;s growing nuclear arsenal. An oft quoted news report described Hayat as &#8220;brainy, brave and bold&#8221; and that he was commissioned in the Artillery regiment in the 80s. The new SPD chief has a tough challenge ahead to reorient the organisation in testing times.\nAs a measure of Lt. Gen. Kidwai&#8217;s crucial importance, it was the outgoing SPD chief who briefed Chief of Army Staff Gen. Raheel Sharif during his visit to the institution last week. Gen. Sharif in a statement said that Pakistan&#8217;s nuclear programme occupied a central place for the defence of the country.\nLt. Gen. Kidwai headed SPD since its inception in 1999 and turned it into a &#8220;true nuclear conclave&#8221; as described by Feroze Hasan Khan in his book <i>Eating Grass: The Making of the Pakistani Bomb</i>. Lt. Gen. Kidwai is quoted in the book as saying that no delegation of authority concerning nuclear weapons is planned, during a lecture in the U.S. in 2006 but already there are reports from the U.S. media expressing concern over his exit after some 12 extensions and the biggest fear is that nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands.\nWhen a similar atmosphere of distrust prevailed in 2008, Lt. Gen. Kidwai had invited the foreign press for an extraordinary briefing which included two Indian journalists. At that time he had reassured everyone that the country&#8217;s strategic assets were in safe hands and that there was &#8220;no conceivable scenario&#8221; in which they could fall into the hands of extremists. He said there was &#8220;no chance that one day there will be a DG SPD here with a long beard who will be controlling everything.&#8221; But the world community now will need much more than assurances and it is not for nothing that the U.S. has reportedly increased surveillance over Pakistan, according to information from whistleblower Edward Snowden which has been refuted by the federal government here.\nMichael Kugelman in a recent article in <i>The National Interest</i> titled &#8220;One More Reason to worry about Pakistan&#8217;s Nukes&#8221; asks the question, &#8220;Is anyone other than Khalid Kidwai capable of managing Pakistan&#8217;s nuclear security challenges, given their sheer magnitude?&#8221;\nStating that there is good reason to be anxious about Lt. Gen. Kidwai&#8217;s departure, he adds that &#8220;Few countries are as prone to a nuclear crisis as Pakistan &#8212; and this threat could well rise in the next year. The withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan portends heightened competition between Pakistan and India for influence in Afghanistan. The U.S. troop withdrawal also deprives militants of a prime target, increasing the likelihood that some jihadists &#8212; including those with ties to Pakistan&#8217;s security establishment &#8212; will launch new campaigns of violence in India. These scenarios could dangerously escalate India-Pakistan tensions, and conceivably trigger armed mobilisations that include Tactical Nuclear Weapons.&#8221; \nIn 2012, security authorities acknowledged a &#8220;serious threat&#8221; from the Pakistani Taliban to attack one of Pakistan&#8217;s largest nuclear installations,&#8221; he points out. However, Pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the safety of its nuclear installations and its credible minimum deterrence policy. \nCentral Information Secretary of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Shireen Mazari, slammed &#8220;the U.S. media campaign launched once again against Pakistan''s nuclear weapons.&#8221;\nLt. Gen. Talat Masood, chief coordinator of the think tank Pugwash told <i>The Hindu</i> that fears of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands was always there but comments are being made by people who don&#8217;t understand Pakistan and equate the nuclear with the conventional weapons set-up. There can be no change as far as safety issues are concerned and the new DG will be even more careful. Even if the control of the nuclear weapons is with the military there is a separate command and control structure protected by a separate force, physically and technology wise and it was secure, he said.\nThe government relies on the new DG and the military leadership had recommended him and SPD had grown into a mature institution, he pointed out. &#8220;Kidwai had a long and productive innings and enjoyed the confidence of both the civil and military leadership and we need to acknowledge his contribution to the nuclear establishment,&#8221; he added.\nIn a 2014 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), in a list of 25 countries Pakistan has been ranked 22 and India 23 in terms of security of nuclear materials with scores of 46 and 41 respectively. While India has criticised the basis of the report, it says, &#8220;Among nuclear-armed states, Pakistan is most improved through a series of steps to update nuclear security regulations and to implement best practices, though it ranks 22nd overall.&#8221; \nHowever, in terms of security control measures, India ranks the lowest below Pakistan among the 25 nuclear countries with weapons-usable nuclear materials. Pakistan is lowest in the ranking for risk environment with 19 points out of 100.\nIn the 2014 NTI Index, the scores of the nine nuclear-armed states remained mostly static, with some states&#8217; scores increasing or decreasing by a single point. Pakistan was a notable exception, with its score increasing by three points compared with 2012, and it demonstrated the largest improvement of any nuclear-armed state, the report said. \nPakistan is taking steps to update its nuclear security regulations and to implement nuclear security best practices. In particular, new regulations have improved its scores in the On-Site Physical Protection indicator. Pakistan also participated in new bilateral and multilateral assistance, although its score for Voluntary Commitments was already high. Despite those positive developments, Pakistan must still improve its regulations for physical protection, control and accounting, and insider threat prevention, the report said.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has also recognised the boy&#8217;s bravery and declared him a hero. According to news reports the chubby schoolboy first asked the person who looked suspicious to stop and when he didn&#8217;t, he reportedly threw a stone at him. \n\nWhen the terrorist started running towards the school, Aitizaz ran after him and tried to grapple with him with fatal consequences, local police said. \n\nHis action has drawn support from a globally famous student who was shot at by the Taliban. Malala Yousafzai according to reports has endorsed Hussain&#8217;s act of bravery and said that he sacrificed his own life and protected hundreds of innocent young students from being killed. She said his bravery must never be forgotten. \n\nEven the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police had recommended a civilian award for the boy. His family too is proud of their son&#8217;s sacrifice. The Ibrahimzai area where the school is located in Hangu district is a Shia-dominated area and a sectarian group had claimed responsibility for the bombing. \n\nBrigadier Nadeem Zaki Manj, Local Commander in Hangu, visited the grave of Aitizaz Hussain and placed a wreath on behalf of the Chief of the Army Staff and offered prayers. He also conveyed the Chief of the Army Staff General Raheel Sharif&#8217;s rich tributes to the bereaved family on the boy''s bravery and sacrifice. Gen.

His medical report does not disclose that the discomfort was due to a heart ailment, the court said in its order.\n\n\nThe report also does not bear out that he had a heart attack. The court had condoned his inability to appear solely due to his being hospitalised despite no requests from the defence, the order said. The court was also constrained to call for a report from the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC) where Musharraf is admitted. The judges noted that the report does not suggest that he is unable to appear in court and also he had not sought exemption. The accused has failed to comply with the orders and accordingly he was directed to appear on January 16, the order said.\n\n\nWhen the trial began on December 24, Mr. Musharraf sought exemption on the grounds of security. At the next hearing on January 1, there was a bomb scare again. On January 2, he developed a heart problem en route the court and was admitted to AFIC. The medical report was submitted in court on January 7 and it was then decided to pass orders today after copies were given to both parties. When proceedings opened Senior defence counsel Sharifuddin Pirzada expressed strong reservations about Musharraf&#8217;s medical report being made public and said it was a private matter. He pointed out that both a coronary angiography and a bypass- which have been suggested for the former President, are difficult procedures and it was upto the individual to decide what course of treatment he wanted to pursue. He also made a reference to the fact the special public prosecutor Akram Sheikh had sought treatment abroad.\n\n\nMr. Sheikh in his turn asked if only the ailments of clients were confidential and it was uncharitable to refer to his illnesses. He denied that the leakage of the medical report was from his office. He demanded that the court issue summons to Musharraf as he could not be exempted on the grounds of the medical report. There was no categorical opinion in it and it does not indicate any disability or apprehended damage if he came to court. He said calcification of the arteries was bound to be there considering the age of the accused but Musharraf&#8217;s blood pressure was that of &#8220;a young man and his pulse rate that of a sportsman.&#8221;\n\n\nMr. Sheikh pointed out that Musharraf was in AFIC for so many days and yet no coronary angiography was done. Does this point to an emergency? he asked. He submitted that the accused has to come and the charges have to be read out to him. After that he can authorise someone to be present on his behalf while the evidence is being presented. \n\nThe question is if Mr. Musharraf is disabled or if even attending half an hour of court is dangerous to his life? he reiterated. He said that while coming to court Musharraf&#8217;s vehicle was diverted to the hospital and quoted newspaper reports as saying that the route to Rawalpindi where AFIC is located was already secured by the police. It was not a sudden diversion, he added.\n\n\nMr. Musharraf was not confined to his hospital bed- he had visitors, including his legal counsels, and received over 1500 flower bouquets, Mr. Sheikh told the court.

But in August 2013, he was in for a rude shock when the exhibition was vandalised by Bajrang Dal members in Ahmedabad&#8217;s &#8220;Amdavad Ni Gufa&#8221; gallery to protest the killing of Indian soldiers by Pakistani army men on the Line of Control. The miscreants tore down the paintings, which included some of his work. The story didn&#8217;t end there.\n\n\nAfter the incident, the International Creative Art Centre (ICAC) which had invited him, refused to respond to his calls and demands to have the paintings back. He had to keep writing and calling them for months, before the ICAC said it couldn&#8217;t send the paintings back to Pakistan because no courier agency was willing to do so. \n\n&#8220;Finally I asked them to send the paintings to Dubai and the whole thing proved very expensive for me,&#8221; he said. He even contacted the India Pakistan Friendship Association president in Mumbai who refused to help saying it didn&#8217;t want to enter into this volatile situation.\n\n\nWhen he got the paintings back with great difficulty last December, he realised that three of them were missing. Two of them were by Akram Spaul and one by R M Naeem. He said that he kept contacting ICAC but had received no response on whether the paintings were damaged beyond repair or sold. He said if they were sold, he would have to pay the artists, but he till now he has no news on them.\n\n\n<b>''Resilient Ambassadors''</b>\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Faisel, a doctor by training who runs Galley 6, organised an exhibition of the vandalised paintings titled &#8220;Resilient Ambassadors&#8221;. A small computer played video footage of the Ahmedabad incident where young men on a rampage could be seen tearing off the paintings and breaking the frames. Some of the paintings on display have been torn, removed from their frames and Mr. Faisel had to cut alarge painting of his which was damaged badly. &#8220;I cut my three ft by two ft painting and repainted it. You can still see the scratch marks and other damage,&#8221; he said pointing to a large brightly coloured frame. Some of the paintings have been ripped apart and some slashed. \n\nHajra Mansoor and her husband Mansoor Rahi were both shocked at the Ahmedabad incident because they had been having regular exchanges in the past. &#8220;When a painting is destroyed, for me it is like killing a child. No art lover would do this, so many people in India loved our work,&#8221; Ms. Mansoor told The Hindu. \n\nShe had studied from the Lucknow Art College and was keen on showing her work in India. &#8221;We have so many friends there and we sell many paintings,&#8221; she said.\n\n\nMansoor Rahi said artists had an important role to play worldwide and these exchange programmes kept friendship alive. &#8220;These people who damage art want to destroy that friendship.

Pervez Musharraf. In a recent TV interview, he admitted that he appeared to have misjudged the government on that count. Despite the best advice from even the former ISI chief and other luminaries, he chose to take his chances in a country he left not in the best of circumstances in 2008. That anticipated groundswell of support for him was missing when he returned in March 2013 and he was not allowed to contest elections as well. \n\nAnd the new government, headed by a man he had thrown out of power once and humiliated, slapped case after case on him. While he managed to get bail in all the cases, the trials are still continuing in the Benazir Bhutto assassination and the Akbar Bugti cases and when it seemed like he could finally leave the country, the government came up with a high treason charge against him for imposing emergency and putting the Constitution in abeyance in November 2007. Acting swiftly, it set up a special court with a three-judge Bench and appointed a special public prosecutor to try him but Mr. Musharraf has managed to avoid appearing so far and on the day he was summoned for the second time, he landed in hospital pleading a heart problem.\n\n\nTwice, explosives were found on the route to the court and the former military dictator absented himself from the hearing on those two days, not leaving his plush farmhouse. Finally, the Bench had to issue another summons and on the day when it seemed like he would finally make an appearance, his convoy was diverted to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi where he was admitted with uneasiness in the chest, sweating and discomfort.\n\n\n<b>Procedural delays</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe court exempted him once again but last week, when even his defence counsels said they had no clue about his health, it called for a medical report from the hospital. A patient Bench finally had to summon him again to appear on January 16 for the charges to be read out to him after it found that the medical report did not indicate Mr. Musharraf had suffered a heart attack. The trial is mired in procedural delays and public opinion is divided on whether it was worth it at all to bring him to book.\n\n\nMr. Musharraf, in a spate of interviews, called on the Army to support him and even claimed it was doing so, though the Pakistani Defence Minister has denied this often enough. Even political parties like the Muttahida Qaumi Movement have been claiming he was being tried for being a Mohajir, a migrant from India, and a section of the political class too is sceptical about what the trial will achieve at a time when Pakistan is engulfed by the challenges of terrorism, a weak economy and acute power shortage.\n\n\nHowever, the Nawaz Sharif government seems determined to take this to the bitter end. Mr. Musharraf&#8217;s lawyers openly spoke about a safe passage being offered to their client even before the trial began. The government later offered to fly home his ailing mother whom he wished to visit in Dubai. The government made it clear it was not going to remove his name from the Exit Control List (ECL) though his wife had made an application. There was also speculation when the Saudi foreign minister arrived that some deal was to be struck which the minister categorically refuted at a press conference.\n\n\n<b>Will he attend?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe question now uppermost in everyone&#8217;s mind is whether Mr. Musharraf will appear at the next hearing on Thursday. His lawyers have tossed the ball into the hospital&#8217;s court saying that if he is well, he can appear. The prosecution led by Akram Sheikh has been contending that there is nothing wrong with the General and he has the blood pressure of a young man and the pulse rate of an athlete as stated in the medical report.\n\n\nIf Mr. Musharraf appears in court, he will be indicted and the trial can then begin. For as long as he doesn&#8217;t, the court cannot proceed in the case, though it continues to hear the several applications filed by the defence, challenging everything from the constitution of the court, the appointment of the special public prosecutor and demanding that the trial can&#8217;t go on because the judges and the prosecution are biased. The court last week ruled that the Code of Criminal Procedure can apply to these proceedings after the defence spent a week arguing against it. This means that Mr. Musharraf can be arrested since all the charges against him are non-bailable, a fact that Judge Faisal Arab, who is heading the court, has been stressing to the defence. So far, he has refrained from issuing a non-bailable warrant and has granted Mr. Musharraf some leeway, keeping in mind his stature as former President and chief of army staff. The federal government and the Prime Minister, who has been trying to instil the rule of law, have clarified that the matter was now in court and it would be decided there. The question is whether the Army will countenance the trial of a former general and chief of staff, howsoever justified the government is in launching proceedings. \n\n<i>meena.menon@thehindu.co.in</i>\n', 'last,high,former,recent,former,other,new,high,special,special,public,second,former,military,last,medical,medical,procedural,public,worth,political,political,sceptical,weak,acute,later,clear,foreign,next,wrong,young,athlete,stated,medical,several,special,public,last,former,federal,former,general,chief,', ' special worth', ' weak wrong', 2, -2, 0, 4),

The new SPD chief has a tough challenge ahead to reorient the organisation in testing times.\nAs a measure of Lt General Kidwai&#8217;s crucial importance, it was the outgoing SPD chief who briefed chief of army staff General Raheel Sharif during his visit to the institution last week. General Sharif in a statement said that Pakistan&#8217;s nuclear programme occupied a central place for the defence of the country.\nLt General Kidwai headed SPD since its inception in 1999 and turned it into a &#8220;true nuclear conclave&#8221; as described by Feroze Hasan Khan in his book <i>Eating Grass: The Making of the Pakistani Bomb</i>. Lt. Gen. Kidwai is quoted in the book as saying that no delegation of authority concerning nuclear weapons is planned, during a lecture in the US in 2006 but already there are reports from the US media expressing concern over the Lt. Gen. Kidwai&#8217;s exit after some 12 extensions and the biggest fear is that nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands.\nWhen a similar atmosphere of distrust prevailed in 2008, Lt Gen Kidwai had invited the foreign press for an extraordinary briefing, which included two Indian journalists. At that time he had reassured everyone that the country&#8217;s strategic assets were in safe hands and that there was &#8220;no conceivable scenario&#8221; in which they could fall into the hands of extremists. He said there was &#8220;no chance that one day there will be a DG SPD here with a long beard who will be controlling everything.&#8221; But the world community now will need much more than assurances and it is not for nothing that the US has reportedly increased surveillance over Pakistan, according to information from whistleblower Edward Snowden which has been refuted by the federal government here.\nMichael Kugelman in a latest article in <i>The National Interest</i> titled &#8220;One More Reason to worry about Pakistan&#8217;s Nukes&#8221; asks the question &#8220;Is anyone other than Khalid Kidwai capable of managing Pakistan&#8217;s nuclear security challenges, given their sheer magnitude?&#8221;\nStating that there is good reason to be anxious about Kidwai&#8217;s departure, he adds that &#8220;Few countries are as prone to a nuclear crisis as Pakistan &#8212; and this threat could well rise in the next year.\nThe withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan portends heightened competition between Pakistan and India for influence in Afghanistan. The U.S. troop withdrawal also deprives militants of a prime target, increasing the likelihood that some jihadists &#8212; including those with ties to Pakistan&#8217;s security establishment &#8212; will launch new campaigns of violence in India. These scenarios could dangerously escalate India-Pakistan tensions, and conceivably trigger armed mobilizations that include Tactical Nuclear Weapons.&#8221; In 2012, security authorities acknowledged a &#8220;serious threat&#8221; from the Pakistani Taliban to attack one of Pakistan&#8217;s largest nuclear installations,&#8221; he points out.\nHowever, Pakistan has repeatedly emphasized the safety of its nuclear installations and its credible minimum deterrence policy. Central Information Secretary of the Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI) Shireen\nMazari, slammed &#8220;the US media campaign launched once again against Pakistan''s nuclear weapons.&#8221;\nLt General Talat Masood, chief coordinator of the think tank Pugwash told <i>The Hindu</i> that fears of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands was always there but comments are being made by people who don&#8217;t understand Pakistan and equate the nuclear with the conventional weapons set up. There can be no change as far as safety issues are concerned and the new DG will be even more careful. Even if the control of the nuclear weapons is with the military there is a separate command and control structure protected by a separate force, physically and technology wise and it was secure, he said.\nThe government relies on the new DG and the military leadership had recommended him and SPD had grown into a mature institution, he pointed out. &#8220;Kidwai had a long and productive innings and enjoyed the confidence of both the civil and military leadership and we need to acknowledge his contribution to the nuclear establishment,&#8221; he added.\nIn a 2014 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), in a list of 25 countries Pakistan has been ranked 22 and India 23 in terms of nuclear materials security conditions with scores of 46 and 41 respectively. While India has criticized the basis of the report, it says &#8220;Among nuclear-armed states, Pakistan is most improved through a series of steps to update nuclear security regulations and to implement best practices, though it ranks 22nd overall.&#8221; However in terms of security control measures, India ranks the lowest below Pakistan among the 25 nuclear countries with weapons usable nuclear materials. Pakistan is lowest in the ranking for risk environment with 19 points out of 100.\nIn the 2014 NTI Index, the scores of the nine nuclear-armed states remained mostly static, with some states&#8217; scores increasing or decreasing by a single point. Pakistan was a notable exception, with its score increasing by three points compared with 2012, and it demonstrated the largest improvement of any nuclear-armed state, the report said. Pakistan is taking steps to update its nuclear security regulations and to implement nuclear security best practices. In particular, new regulations have improved its scores in the On-Site Physical Protection indicator. Pakistan also participated in new bilateral and multilateral assistance, although its score for Voluntary Commitments was already high. Despite those positive developments, Pakistan must still improve its regulations for physical protection, control and accounting, and insider threat prevention, the report said.

The blast which shook the nearby buildings and was heard for miles injured eleven persons including policemen.\n\n\nKhan survived a suicide attack on his house in 2011 which claimed eight lives. He had told the media then that he was not going to be scared by such tactics and the terrorists had in fact &#8220;put their hand in a lion&#8217;s mouth&#8221;. That was one of several attempts on his life but his luck seemed to have run out this evening. The deafening explosion at Hassan Square on Lyari Expressway reportedly caused by suicide bombers who were waiting for the convoy, blew up the vehicle in which the police men were travelling back to their office. The vehicle was reduced to a tangled mass of metal. News reports said that Khan was not using his bomb proof vehicle today but police clarified that it was bullet proof.\n\n\nInitial reports said that the police vehicle was rammed into by another car which had explosives, but this was not confirmed. Police are still investigating the blast which is suspected to be caused either by the car laden with powerful explosives or by suicide bombers.\n\n\nA man who once vowed to wipe out the Taliban was shot at several times but escaped each time. &#8220;As long as I am alive every drop of my blood will be used to fight terrorists,&#8221; he said in a TV interview. \n\nHours before his death he had launched an operation which killed three Taliban militants in the Manghopir area which he spoke about in a press conference. The government had launched a targeted operation to flush out criminals and target killers in the city which reported 2700 deaths in the worst wave of violence in 2013 and over 40,000 cases of crime. Over nine thousand raids were conducted last year by the police and security agencies with over 13,000 arrests.\n\n\nKarachi is caught in a vortex of crime, sectarian violence and terrorism which the government decided to tackle by giving carte blanche to the police. However, nearly 200 police and security personnel have lost their lives fighting the spiraling crime and terrorism.\n\n\nNews reports said the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan had claimed responsibility for the blast. News of the blast received widespread condemnation and political leaders and activists called for a rethink on the government&#8217;s proposal to have a dialogue with the Pakistan Taliban. It is also seen as a major setback to the fight against terrorists in the commercial capital.

If there was to be any reconciliation, the Pakistanis intended to control it,&#8221; Mr. Gates said.\n\n\nIn his memoir running into more than 600 pages, Mr. Gates says weeks before his inauguration, Mr. Obama asked him to travel to Chicago to attend a meeting of his transition&#8217;s national security team, which among others was attended by Ms. Hillary Clinton and Mr. Joe Biden.\n\n\nThe meeting, held in December, spent nearly an hour discussing on Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, Mr. Gates writes.\n\n\n&#8220;Pakistan was described as the biggest, most dangerous situation,&#8221; he writes.\n\n\nIn Mach 2009, Mr. Gates writes, Mr. Obama held a series of meetings on his Af-Pak to discuss report of Bruce Riedel, who was appointed by the President. One of those Friday, he writes, they reviewed the final Riedel report.\n\n\nThis &#8220;recommended disrupting the terrorist networks in Afghanistan and especially Pakistan, promoting a more effective government in Afghanistan, developing the Afghan security forces, ending Pakistan&#8217;s support for terrorist and insurgent groups, enhancing civilian control in Pakistan, and using US diplomatic, military, and intelligence channels to reduce enmity and distrust between Pakistan and India. It was breathtaking in its ambition,&#8221; Mr. Gates writes.\n\n\nWhen Obama announced his Af-Pak strategy, Mr. Gates said he had reservations on Pakistan&#8217;s co-operation.\n\n\n&#8220;I also doubted we could persuade the Pakistanis to change their &#8216;calculus&#8217; and go after the Afghan and other extremists on their side of the border. When a Pakistani Taliban offensive that spring reached within sixty miles of Islamabad the Pakistani army went after them in the border provinces of Swat and South Waziristan for their own protection.\n\n\n&#8220;Their continuing toleration of the Afghan Taliban, including harbouring their leaders in Quetta was a hedging strategy based on their lack of trust in us, given unwillingness to stay engaged in Afghanistan in the early 1990s,&#8221; he writes.\n\n\nSuch was his distrust of Pakistan that, he writes, when they were planning for Osama bin Laden raid, he was worried that the ISI was aware of the al-Qaeda chief&#8217;s whereabouts.\n\n\n&#8220;I worried that Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence was aware of where Bin Laden was and that there might be rings of security around the compound that we knew nothing about or, at minimum, that 1ST might have more eyes on the compound than we could know,&#8221; he wrote.\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario was that the Pakistanis could get a number of troops to the compound quickly, prevent extraction of our team and take them prisoner, he writes.\n\n\nWhen he asked his Vice Admiral William McRaven what he planned to do if the Pakistani military showed up during the operation, he said the team would just hunker down and wait for a &#8220;diplomatic extraction.&#8221;\n\n\n&#8220;They would wait inside the compound and not shoot any Pakistanis. I then asked what they would do if the Pakistanis breached the walls: &#8216;Do you shoot or surrender?&#8217; Our team couldn&#8217;t surrender, I said. If the Pakistani military showed up, our team needed to be prepared to do whatever was necessary to escape,&#8221; Mr. Gates writes.\n\n\n&#8220;After considerable discussion, there was broad agreement to this, and as a result, additional MH-47 helicopters and forces were assigned to the mission,&#8221; he says.\n\n\nMr. Gates writes that ahead of the Abbottabad raid no one inside the administration talked about seeking Pakistani help in killing bin Laden.\n\n\n&#8220;No one thought we should ask the Pakistanis for help or permission. In every instance when we had provided a heads-up to the Pakistan military or intelligence services, the target was forewarned and fled, or the Pakistanis went after the target unilaterally, prematurely and unsuccessfully,&#8221; he says.\n\n\nThe successful bin Laden raid, he writes, was humiliating for the Pakistan Army.\n', 'former,second,last,senior,consistent,safe,next,such,profitable,same,sanctuary,other,top,national,dangerous,final,effective,civilian,diplomatic,military,distrust,other,offensive,own,early,aware,aware,minimum,military,inside,military,necessary,considerable,broad,additional,military,successful,', ' broad consistent diplomatic effective necessary profitable safe sanctuary successful top', ' dangerous offensive', 10, -2, 8, 12),

Musharraf was admitted to AFIC last week after he developed a heart problem on his way to the court. \n\nThe special court trying Gen. Musharraf for high treason on Monday granted another exemption to the former military ruler from making an appearance and also said it did not find it appropriate to issue non-bailable warrants as demanded by the prosecution. Justice Faisal Arab, who is heading the three-member court, said that it is not a case that the accused had disappeared, he was at his residence and two cases of exemption were already granted. It&#8217;s a known fact that he is in hospital, he stated.\n\n\nGen. Musharraf&#8217;s lawyers had already announced that he was not going to appear today.

He said there were intra court appeals pending against the Islamabad High Court order dismissing all the petitions challenging the constitution of the court, alleging bias by the judges and against his own appointment, which he said was not mentioned while filing these applications in this court. \n\nThe special court had no plenary powers and the trial cannot be adjourned due to the illness of an accused.

Musharraf on Thursday to indict him and senior defence counsel Sharifuddin Pirzada even told the court that he could make an appearance. However, later the court was informed by the Inspector General of Police, Security, Jan Mohammed that he was coming to the court when his convoy was diverted to the hospital. The police which has deployed 1000 personnel along the route from Gen. Musharraf&#8217;s farmhouse at Chak Shahzad to the National Library building was taken by surprise. The entire security apparatus was waiting at his house since 8 am, the police said. However news reports also said that there was security on the route to Rawalpindi.\n\n\nSpecial Public Prosecutor Akram Sheikh told the court that he demanded the issuance of a non bailable warrant for the former military ruler since he has not obeyed two summonses issued by the court. If he is suffering from an illness, let the law take its course, Mr. Sheikh submitted. Gen. Musharraf&#8217;s defence lawyers said that their client had gone to hospital due to an illness and it should not give the impression that he was not complying with the court order. Khalid Ranjha, defence counsel told the court that the issue was security but Gen. Musharraf was on his way with the security officers when he had a heart problem. The court order is complied with, he pointed out. \n\nWhen proceedings began this morning defence counsel Anwar Mansoor told the court that he was harassed and kept awake all night by someone who kept banging the door of his flat and ringing the doorbell. He said under these circumstances he could not continue with the case. He later walked out of the court in protest.\n\n\nAfter that there was a harangue between the lawyers of the defence and the prosecution teams who accused other of issuing threats and intimidation and flung accusations at each other. The court observed that it had never witnessed such scenes and these things usually happened at the school or college level. Justice Faisal Arab called on the senior-most counsel Mr. Pirzada to intervene and passed an order that the two teams should not interact with each other since it amounts to interrupting court proceedings. \n\nMr. Pirzada said in this tense atmosphere the court should adjourn the proceeding still Monday. He said the defence counsel was being threatened and the dignity of the court needs to be maintained.\n\n\nThe court kept asking about whether Gen. Musharraf was appearing or not and finally said that it would have to issue a warrant. This was before Gen. Musharraf developed a problem and his vehicle was diverted to the hospital. The court will decide on the three petitions filed by the defence challenging the constitution of the court, alleging bias among the judges and whether the Code of Criminal Procedure applies to the proceedings later and hear arguments from the prosecution on Monday.\n', 'Former,special,high,special,hospital,third,other,intensive,critical,uneasy,senior,convicted,special,senior,later,bailable,former,military,hospital,due,flat,later,other,flung,such,other,later,hear,', ' special', ' uneasy', 1, -1, 0, 2),

The court is conducting a trial of high treason under Article 6 of the Constitution against the former military ruler.\n\n\nJustice Faisal Arab said that last time the court had granted a onetime exemption to Gen. Musharraf and yet again there is a bomb scare and the accused feels his journey from his residence to the court will not be safe. Responding to Gen. Musharraf not appearing for the second time, Justice Arab who is heading the three member court said as a matter of indulgence the court was granting him another exemption. Earlier he said since he was former president, it did not want to humiliate him by issuing a warrant for his arrest but if he does not appear on Thursday then the law will take its course. He has not sought bail either, the court pointed out. In the last hearing he said being a former President and ex-Army chief the court chose not to issue a warrant, and issued a summons instead so he can come without embarrassment.\n\n\nDefence lawyer Ahmed Raza Kasuri said Musharraf was willing to come to court even the last time but there were security hassles and even on Wednesday there was a bomb scare. He said there were TV reports of explosive material found near Bani Gala which is close to Gen. Musharraf&#8217;s farmhouse. The court is responsible if anything happened to the former president and it has to ensure his safety, he said. Justice Arab told him not to threaten the court. Mr. Kasuri continued by saying that if there is a blast in court everyone will be killed. The venue (the National Library auditorium) is not secure, he submitted saying it looks more like a Shakespearian theatre and not a court. He said there were many episodes where people have been killed, for example Liaqat Ali , Benazir Bhutto, Rajiv Gandhi and Sheikh Mujibur Rehman. Justice Arab said courts functioned even in war time and it cannot keep cases on hold. Last week the court had asked the registrar to ensure that adequate security arrangements were made for Gen. Musharraf. \n\nEarlier the Inspector-General (Security) Jan Mohammed who was called on to make a statement told the court that the police had made the best arrangements &#8220;within our resources&#8221;. He said there were resource constraints, to which the court said that it was not a good enough answer. He said the police did not have bullet or bombproof vehicles.\n\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Inspector General Islamabad Sikandar Hayat said that 1,000 men were deployed including Pakistan Rangers on security detail for Gen. Musharraf apart from other special security forces including the bomb disposal squad, and the police were doing what is humanly possible.\n\n\nOn Thursday, the court, apart from indicting Gen. Musharraf if he makes an appearance, will also decide on the petitions filed by the defence challenging the constitution of the court and if the Criminal Procedure Code applies to the special court. Anwar Mansoor argued on behalf of the defence that the judges had a bias against their client and they would not ensure a fair trial. He also said the notification appointing the special court was illegal. The complaint against Gen. Musharraf was filed in the court by the secretary interior ministry and the police were directly under him, so the defence had no faith in the police, he submitted. Mr. Mansoor said that on the last date when he left the capital to go to Lahore his car was attacked and the police refused to register a complaint. He asked the court why it was proceeding with the case when the defence counsels were being attacked. He said a black car with tinted glasses without a number plate had rammed into his vehicle and it was a total loss. Later the court directed him to file a police complaint with the concerned senior superintendent of police.\n\n\nSpecial Public prosecutor Akram Sheikh later told reporters that Gen. Musharraf has been summoned again and he can either apply for bail, or surrender. The court has to indict him in the case. The defence also filed a contempt of court application against the Prime Minister for a statement in the media quoting him as saying that the Supreme Court judgment holding that the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) promulgated by Gen. Musharraf was unconstitutional was the most important evidence if any in the trial under Article 6 of the Constitution against Gen. Musharraf.

The attack took place when children were being administered the vaccine, according to reports. \n\nSpokesperson for the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) Shiraz Paracha told <i>The Hindu</i> on the phone that Matani has been targeted before and was a trouble spot. \n\nHe said the government had launched an awareness drive on polio since there was a lot of suspicion about the campaign, specially after Dr. Shakeel Afridi was arrested on charges of helping the CIA locate Osama Bin Laden using the pretext of a polio vaccination programme. \n\nThe government has given top priority to the anti-polio programme and was recruiting more people to be part of it. \n\nMore than a law and order issue, there were deep-rooted socio cultural factors against the vaccination which was affecting the programme, he said. \n\nPakistan Tehreek e Insaf chairperson Imran Khan had recently launched an anti-polio drive in KPK in a bid to thwart the misconceptions about the vaccine. \n\nPolio workers have been targeted in Matani earlier as well and this time it was the turn of the main official behind the anti polio drive according to one news report. \n\nThis month there have been three attacks which killed two polio workers and two security guards escorting the teams in Jamrud in Khyber Agency and Swabi.

Sri Lanka says it has already scaled back troops from a war-time peak of 175,000, and promised that a further drawdown will take place as de-mining and reconstruction operations are completed. \n\nPresident Rajapaksa, Mr. Khurshid said, in turn asked India to use its offices to persuade Tamil parties to engage with Parliament on devolution of powers to the Northern and Eastern provinces. Mr. Khursheed quoted Mr. Rajapakse as saying that Tamil engagement was critical to building a consensus among Sri Lankan political parties on devolution. \n\nThe 25-minute meeting was the first between the two leaders since 2012, when India first voted against Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council, and comes against the backdrop of criticism by political parties in Tamil Nadu. \n\n<b>Engagement with Sri Lanka will help Tamils: Khurshid</b>\n\n\n&#8220;I hope that both our friends and critics in Tamil Nadu will keep foremost in their minds the interests of the Tamils of the Northern Provinces&#8221;, Mr. Khurshid said. &#8220;When I went to the Northern Provinces, I did not hear a single voice calling on us not to engage with the Sri Lanka government&#8221;. \n\n&#8220;Everyone in politics has the rights to promote their interests&#8221;, Mr. Khurshid added, &#8220;as long as they keep the national interest in mind.

The two countries have, however, committed to be in touch as India firms up its position. \n\nThe draft resolution, sponsored by the United Kingdom, United States, Mauritius, Macedonia, Montenegro, calls for the United Nations human rights commissioner to continue investigating war crimes allegedly committed by Sri Lanka&#8217;s armed forces. It welcomes progress in reconstruction and recently-held provincial elections, but adds that considerable work lies ahead in justice, reconciliation and demilitarisation. \n\nIndia controversially voted against Sri Lanka at the UNHRC in 2012 and 2013, reversing its traditional opposition to international intervention in countries&#8217; domestic affairs. \n\nDr. Singh also did not attend a Commonwealth summit in Sri Lanka last year, in response to intense opposition from political parties in Tamil Nadu.

The Assam police have intelligence inputs that Barua is currently operating out of his base along Myanmar-China border.\nThe seized consignment included 4,930 sophisticated firearms of different types, 840 rocket launchers, 300 rockets, 27,020 grenades, 2,000 grenade-launching tubes, 6,392 magazines and 11.41 million bullets.\nR.N. Ravi, an expert on the north-east, who earlier served with the Intelligence Bureau, said the Bangladesh court sentence would not have any direct impact on Barua, except a psychological impact on those cadres who are still staying in the neighbouring country.\nMr Ravi, however, felt that if Barua ever comes over for talks with the Indian government, then Bangladesh might seek his extradition and India might be under pressure to hand him over for trial by the Bangladeshi court.

That nation is in serious turmoil. In the last two years, the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party&#8211;Jamaat-e-Islami combine has been partially successful in using its massive economic clout and propaganda apparatus to portray itself as a victim of state-sponsored witch-hunting. \n\nThe &#8216;witch-hunting&#8217; boils down to two things that can finish off the Jamaat as a viable political force. The first is the de-registration of the Jamaat as an electoral force as per a Supreme court order that bars any party that &#8220;puts God before the democratic process&#8221;. The second is the war crimes trial of those who committed crimes against humanity during 1971. Much of the present Jamaat leadership was heavily involved in murder, rape, arson and forced conversions. In a subcontinent where politics thrives on the erasure of public memory, this episode has stubbornly refused to disappear. A dilly-dallying Awami League government was almost forced by the youth movement in Shahbag to pursue the war crimes trial seriously. Facing the prospect of political annihilation, the Jamaat responded by a three-pronged offensive. It marshalled its cadres and young Madrassa students and use them for blockading Dhaka. It lent its activists to a BNP in disarray to act as boots on the ground. It carried out targeted attacks on the homes, businesses and places of worship of Hindus, the nation&#8217;s largest religious minority.\n\n\nIn 2001, after the BNP-led alliance won the elections, the usual pattern of murder, rape and arson targeting Hindus happened on a very large scale. Hindus have traditionally voted for the Awami League. The guarantee for &#8216;<i>jaan</i> and <i>maal</i>&#8217; (life and property) is important for the survival of any people. In the Awami League regime, although property and homestead have been regularly taken away by the powerful persons of the party, systematic attacks on minorities are not part of the party&#8217;s policy. The same cannot be said of the BNP-Jamaat partnership, which regularly threatened both <i>jaan</i> and <i>maal</i>. It is not hard to see why Hindus chose the devil over the deep sea. This time, Hindus seemed to be out of favour from both sides. While they were targeted by the BNP-Jamaat for coming out to vote at all, in other areas they were targeted by Awami League rebels for coming out to vote for the official Awami League candidate who happened to be of the Hindu faith. There have been disturbing signs over the past few years that at the local level, the difference between the &#8216;secular&#8217; Awami League and the communal-fundamentalist BNP-Jamaat is beginning to disappear, though publicly the former does not tire in parroting the staunchly secular ideals of 1971.\n\n\n<b>A throwback to 1971</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe violence unleashed against the Hindus this time, before and after the January 5 polls, have been worst in Jessore, Dinajpur and Satkhira, though many other places like Thakurgaon, Rangpur, Bogra, Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Rajshahi and Chittagong have been affected. Malopara in Abhaynagar, Jessore, inhabited by Bengali Dalit castes, has been attacked repeatedly. Large-scale attacks on villages, businesses and places of worship, able-bodied men being on night vigils, women huddling together in one place &#8212; all these things brought back memories of 1971 for many of the inhabitants. \n\nIn Hazrail Rishipara of Jessore, women were raped at gunpoint for the crime that their families had voted in the election. Dinajpur has been badly hit with cases of beatings, arson on homes, shops, haystacks and crops. Both Jessore and Dinajpur being areas bordering West Bengal, crossing the border in self-preservation is a sad trek that many have undergone. It creates an environment that forces the remaining Hindus to ask the question &#8216;Why am I still here?&#8217; &#8216;Partition&#8217; continues.\n\n\nThe &#8216;Partition&#8217; was swift and vicious in the Punjabs and Sindh where religious minorities have ceased to exist for all practical purposes. This is not so in the Bengals, where many still live on the ancestral land claimed by nations whose legitimacies are much more recent than people&#8217;s ancestral claims over their homestead. More than 25 per cent of Bengal&#8217;s western half&#8217;s population is Mohammeddan (the figure was 19.46 per cent in 1951, after the 1947 Partition). In the eastern half, 8.5 per cent of the population is Hindu (it was 22 per cent in 1951). In Bengal, secularism has political currency. It was one of the foundational principles of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\n\nHow did things come to be this way? The autocratic years of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&#8217;s BAKSAL, the long years of army rule when the barracks used Islam to create a veneer of political legitimacy beyond the Awami League and pro-liberation forces, the overtures by mainstream parties to fundamentalist groupings &#8212; all these have given religion-based politics a front-row seat in the nation. Religiopolitical organisations have not been immune to the violent turn of this brand of politics internationally in the last two decades. Pro-Pakistan forces, which looked to faith-unity as the basis of statehood, did not disappear after the Liberation War. They were broadly and transiently (as it increasingly seems) de-legitimised due to their role in the atrocities of 1971. \n\nBut what about the project &#8212; that religion marks a nation? What about the splinters of such an idea stuck deep in political and societal structures? That trend has persisted, even expanded. In the imagination of all the ruling factions since 1947 during East Bengal, East Pakistan and Bangladesh periods, there has been a tacit understanding of the normative citizen &#8212; a Mohameddan Bengali male or a Bengali Mohameddan male. Hindus there are a living reminder of an identity that is not fully coterminous with ideas that conflate Bengaliness (or &#8216;Bangladeshiness&#8217;) with that normative citizen. Their progressive numerical marginality makes this conflation project easier. Such projects often live in the underside of mindscapes that can be &#8216;secular&#8217; in very many declarations. Thus, they can be marginalised without being actively targeted, in &#8216;innocuous&#8217; everyday dealings. \n\nThe majority can decide to be whatever it wants and the minority has to follow suit in a modern nation-state. So, Bengali Hindus were expected to become &#8216;Pakistanis&#8217; overnight in 1947 just as others elsewhere were expected to suddenly become &#8216;Indians&#8217;. While Bengali Muslim politicians have the autonomous agency to de-Pakistanise themselves at will, East Bengali Hindus could only publicly do so upon an explicit cue from their Bengali Muslim brethren. Just like other minorities, &#8220;extra-territorial loyalty&#8221; is the slur that is bandied about. And this is also what makes minorities cautious, anxious and lesser citizens in a polity where they cannot critique their state in all the ways a majority community person can.\n\n\nStill one cannot but hope that the People&#8217;s Republic of Bangladesh would live up to some of its original ideals. Minorities have fled the nation-state for want of security in large numbers, year after year. There is significant presence of minorities in the bureaucracy and local administration. Even during the recent spate of violence, the state has transferred police officials for failing to provide security. This reality exists too. It is this reality that partly prevents a mass exodus of Hindus beyond the levels seen at present. For many, they have too much to lose to be able to leave. And that is a problem for a religious majoritarian nation-state.\n\n\n<i>(The writer is a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</i>\n', 'Few,past,much,secular,serious,last,successful,massive,economic,viable,political,first,electoral,democratic,second,trial,Much,public,trial,political,young,religious,usual,large,jaan,maal,important,powerful,systematic,same,jaan,maal,other,past,few,local,former,secular,worst,many,other,many,sad,many,vicious,religious,practical,many,live,ancestral,recent,ancestral,political,foundational,autocratic,long,army,political,immune,last,due,such,political,societal,normative,coterminous,conflate,normative,progressive,numerical,live,many,modern,autonomous,other,cautious,anxious,original,want,large,significant,local,recent,many,able,religious,', ' able autonomous democratic important large live modern original powerful practical progressive significant successful viable', ' anxious autocratic cautious sad serious trial vicious worst', 14, -8, 6, 22),

(837, '258', 'January 11, 2014', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/backing-bangladesh/article5563231.ece', 'By every account, the January 5 election, Bangladesh&#8217;s 10th so far, was a low point for democracy. The boycott of the 18-member Opposition alliance meant half the seats Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&#8217;s Awami League (AL) won were uncontested, and about half of the remainder were against unknown candidates with estimates of the turnout just 22-30% of the voting population. Ms. Hasina has now returned to a parliament that echoes only with her voice, but the voice is a hollow one, like the victory itself. Ms. Hasina may have won a three-fourths majority in the &#8216;Jatiyo Sangshad&#8217;, but three-fourths of her electorate didn&#8217;t vote. For her rival, Khaleda Zia, whose Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led the boycott, there are parallels to her own victory in February 1996, when Ms. Hasina boycotted the polls, until widespread protests forced a second election that Ms. Hasina won in June 1996. While it is significant that India has backed the polls, it is equally important to notice that the United States slammed them, saying it is &#8220;disappointed&#8221;, and the United Kingdom, Australia and the European Union have called for another poll at the earliest. Ms. Hasina has also come under much criticism for putting Ms. Zia under a virtual house arrest in the lead-up to the elections, which Ms. Zia described as the &#8220;death of democracy&#8221;.\nIndia has done well to defend Bangladesh from the international onslaught and from the comments of human rights organisations that have followed. There are several reasons why Ms. Hasina had no alternative but to hold elections. To begin with, Bangladesh would have been headed for a constitutional crisis if they had not been held in January. Ms. Hasina&#8217;s decision to hold them without a caretaker government at the helm was, in fact, mandated by the Supreme Court. Secondly, Ms. Hasina can hardly be blamed if other parties chose to boycott. In 1992, terror-torn Punjab saw an election that was boycotted by all but one of the Akali parties, where the Congress&#8217;s Beant Singh was elected Chief Minister by winning just 9% of the potential electorate.\n Ms. Hasina&#8217;s supporters would also argue that Bangladesh has seen some of the worst targeted violence in the run-up to these elections. More than 100 people have been killed in the past few months, in protests and clashes by members of the Opposition, the violence driven largely by members of the Jamaat-e-Islami that was banned from politics five months ago. Bearing the brunt of the anti-election clashes have been the country&#8217;s minorities, notably Hindu villages where thousands have had their homes burned in Jessore and Southern Chittagong, and have been forced to take shelter in temples and neighbouring areas. Many have likened the targeting to the pre-liberation pogrom carried out by Jamaati leaders in 1971 that they are now facing war crimes tribunals over. In taking them on, Ms. Hasina has faced formidable opposition, not just from within Bangladesh, but from the international community. \nThe U.S. has consistently issued statements against Ms. Hasina&#8217;s government for the working of that tribunal, getting vocal support from British parliamentarians, and groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Ms. Hasina has stayed the course in supporting those trials, carrying out the execution of Jamaati leaders at no small cost to her image domestically and internationally. Ms. Hasina has also risked losing some of Bangladesh&#8217;s biggest donors from Saudi Arabia after she took on NGOs that she claimed were funding jihadist activities by JI cadres.\nGiven this situation, it would seem natural that many in India would call for South Block to play a protector&#8217;s role for Ms. Hasina and the Awami League, and balance out some of the pressures she faces. Yet, this too, would be a blunder. India is too strategically powerful and too close a neighbour to play a partisan role in favouring any political party over another in Bangladesh. \n For all but two of the past 22 years post Army-rule, it has been these two &#8216;begums&#8217; that have been in power. Despite its concerns over Ms. Zia and the BNP&#8217;s policies, India gains little by political partisanship. South Block has burned its fingers playing that game in the neighbourhood in the past: in 2008, then National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan had indicated India&#8217;s preference for Sushil Koirala&#8217;s Nepali Congress Party, and then had to walk backwards an uncomfortable distance after the Maoists won the polls. In 2012, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called Maldivian President Mohammed Waheed to congratulate him for assuming power, and lost face after it became clear the move was completely undemocratic, and India then spent much time championing the cause of deposed President Nasheed, who eventually lost the recent election. \nEven in the run-up to the Bangladesh elections, India&#8217;s open support for Ms. Hasina became the biggest reason for the criticism against her. When Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh went to meet Jatiya Party chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad to dissuade him from boycotting the polls, the move boomeranged badly. At a press conference called directly after the meeting, Mr. Ershad announced that Ms. Singh had told him India was &#8220;opposed to the rise of parties allied to the Jamaat-e-Islami&#8221;, and the rhetoric against India only rose with the perception that it was playing a larger role than Bangladeshis would want any foreign country to play. \nIn a recent article in the <i>Dhaka Tribune</i> titled, &#8220;Why India should rethink its Bangladesh policy,&#8221; social media activist Shafquat Rabee criticises India for backing Ms. Hasina despite the crackdown by her on the Opposition. The article says: &#8220;Many in Bangladesh now believe in the following grave accusations: that India is behind the day&#8211;to-day security protection of certain Bangladeshi leaders. India is carrying out stealth operations inside Bangladesh wearing Bangladeshi forces&#8217; dresses. India has trained and sent special operations teams in Bangladesh. India is lobbying Western countries to take Ms. Hasina&#8217;s side.&#8221; Clearly, the belief is outrageous and unfounded, but India must avoid the impression that it has put its hopes on only one political party or leader.\n Instead, India must play a role that favours Bangladesh regardless of which party rules it and the first step would be to simply keep its promises. More than two years after Dr. Singh made his historic visit to Dhaka along with several Chief Ministers, his promises of ratifying the Land Border Agreement, and of clearing the Teesta water settlement haven&#8217;t been fulfilled. Instead, in Bangladesh&#8217;s narrative, they are being seen as symbols of India&#8217;s unreliability, if not its perfidy.\nOn the economic front too, there is much India can do to back Bangladesh. The violence of the past year has had a disastrous impact on its textiles industry that accounts for about 75% of its economy. According to the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), export orders have come down by half in the past three months, and nearly one billion dollars worth of business could be at risk if the situation doesn&#8217;t improve by June 2014. India&#8217;s garments exports business is a rival of Bangladesh&#8217;s, but there is no reason why India can&#8217;t pick up some of the slack in Bangladesh&#8217;s exports for its own retailers. In the field of IT and telecommunications too, for example, Indian companies must be encouraged to invest in Bangladesh, which is poised for a second revolution once it speeds up its internet access. \nIn the bigger picture, the key to prosperity in both Bangladesh and India&#8217;s north-eastern States is the development of the highway and infrastructure corridors to the east. The road to East Asia has been cut off for far too long, even as ASEAN countries have built wealth and inter-dependence through interconnectivity amongst themselves.\nNone of these may be possible in the short run, even as Ms. Hasina prepares to grapple with the political crisis that the elections have thrown up. But as she reaches out to her rivals, and as Ms. Zia hints at a possible rethink on the alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, India must make its voice heard in favour of Bangladesh, the nation, rather than specific parties. It would seem obvious that the current parliament would be a temporary one, until reconciliation is effected in Bangladesh&#8217;s polity, and all of Bangladesh heads to vote in the next election. For, as U.S. political commentator Thomas Keane wrote recently, &#8220;The solution to bad elections isn&#8217;t no elections.

As many as 30 people died on the election weekend, and on voting day activists and supporters of the boycotting parties went about burning polling booths. The Election Commission says the turnout was just less than 40 per cent, a figure hotly contested by the Opposition which put it at a quarter of that. In any case it was nowhere close to the nearly 80 per cent turnout in 2008 &#8212; the highest in Bangladesh &#8212; that gave Sheikh Hasina a landslide victory. This time, the Awami League was assured of victory even before a single vote was cast &#8212; it faced no contest in half of the 300 parliamentary seats due to the boycott. In the remaining ones, the party faced opposition from its own dissidents, and won 110, thus obtaining an absolute majority. Although Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has declared her satisfaction with the turnout, and asked law enforcing authorities to quell the continuing unrest with an &#8220;iron hand&#8221;, she must know that questions about the credibility of this election will not easily vanish. In a nation that has worked hard to build some of the best social indicators in South Asia &#8212; Bangladesh has cut ahead of India on reducing poverty and malnutrition, infant and maternal mortality rates and gender disparities &#8212; such unending political and civil strife can only undermine the gains of the last few years.\n\n\nThe Bangladesh Prime Minister has rejected calls, including by the United States, for dialogue with the Opposition and fresh elections. She has declared that talks with the Opposition can be held only when the BNP ends &#8220;violence and terrorism&#8221; and severs its alliance with the banned Jamaat-e-Islami. But a mid-term election may become a necessity if the political chaos does not abate. It is time the Awami League realised that while its fight against Islamism is a good fight, it simply cannot be won by polarising the nation politically. It will take two, though. BNP leader Khaleda Zia needs to discover better alternatives to expressing political differences than holding the country ransom to street violence and thuggery. As for her dalliance with Islamism, she has Pakistan&#8217;s example to see what opportunistic alliances with religious extremism can do to a country. New Delhi&#8217;s description of the elections as a &#8220;constitutional requirement&#8221; that Prime Minister Hasina has fulfilled, is too nuanced to serve any useful purpose; in fact, it only makes it seem partisan.

At the heart of the confrontation is the election itself. The BNP, along with its allies, is boycotting the election because it wants a neutral caretaker government to oversee the process. Doing away with the constitutional provision for a transitional caretaker was among the earliest of the changes that the Awami League government brought in, with a Supreme Court ruling providing the basis for that move. What Prime Minister Hasina offered instead was a national government, which too was rejected by the BNP. Its leader Khaleda Zia is virtually under house arrest. Another political figure, the former military ruler H.M. Ershad, who heads the Jatiyo Party, the second largest in the ruling coalition, was taken to a military hospital by police commandos after he announced that he too was boycotting the polls. As a result, the Awami League is the only big party that remains in the elections, the Jamat-i-Islami having been banned in 2013. The ruling party is certain to win at least half the 300 seats that are going uncontested. But in such a moth-eaten election, a victory will have nowhere near the kind of legitimacy that it enjoyed when it won in 2008.\n\n\nThe crisis poses a serious challenge for India&#8217;s policy on Bangladesh. It is no secret that New Delhi&#8217;s relations with Dhaka have been best with the Awami League in power. From the point of view of India&#8217;s foreign policy, and more particularly national security objectives, ties have never been better than in the last five years. Prime Minister Hasina cracked down on Islamist extremism, and on safe havens for militants from the northeastern States. Yet, this very equation has set off an incredible amount of anti-India feeling within Bangladesh, especially as New Delhi was seen as not reciprocating Dhaka&#8217;s &#8220;concessions&#8221; in equal measure &#8212; the non-implementation of the Teesta Accord is one sore point. India could have helped at least by counselling Prime Minister Hasina to take less reckless positions against her opponents, but it is too late for that now. Post-election, Bangladesh appears headed for more volatility, and New Delhi&#8217;s relations with a government that comes to power through a problematic process will only get more complicated.\n', 'little,main,political,indefinite,likely,neutral,constitutional,transitional,national,political,former,military,second,military,only,big,certain,such,serious,foreign,national,last,incredible,equal,late,problematic,complicated,', ' incredible', ' complicated indefinite little problematic serious', 1, -5, -4, 6),

(895, '258', 'December 5, 2013', 'http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/bangladeshs-new-radical-islamists/article5422356.ece', '\nBangladesh is set to go to the polls on January 5, 2014 to elect its 10th Parliament amid a protracted political crisis. The Opposition combine has initiated a new wave of violent agitation to undo what it calls a &#8220;unilateral election.&#8221; However, it is unlikely that the Election Commission will cancel the polls it has announced to meet the nation&#8217;s constitutional obligations, unless the political players manage a negotiated settlement of the crisis.\n\n\nInterestingly, the political crisis of the small South Asian nation has drawn global attention of varying dimensions. Some of Bangladesh&#8217;s &#8220;foreign friends&#8221; are subscribing to what the ruling &#8220;pro-liberation&#8221; secular political parties stand for, and others are possibly lending weight to the anti-government protagonists who largely pursue political Islam, including militancy.\n\n\nThe stand taken by the country&#8217;s &#8220;foreign friends&#8221; has come into public discourse too. The Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies see an &#8220;Indian hand&#8221; behind the ruling Awami League&#8217;s views, while the Awami League and its allies see an &#8220;overt U.S. support&#8221; for the BNP-Jamaat coalition.\n\n\n<b>1971 liberation war</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe United States has had frosty relations with the Awami League since the time it supported Pakistan (then West Pakistan) during Bangladesh&#8217;s Liberation War in 1971. That the Awami League has a somewhat socialist orientation and maintains closer ties with India, could also be other reasons for Washington&#8217;s antipathy.\n\n\nThe U.S. is for a &#8220;constructive dialogue&#8221; between the major political parties and against any election excluding the main opposition party. Even though India is a strategic ally of the U.S., the two countries are not in common understanding of the Bangladesh situation.\n\n\nThe reasons may be more than one. Bangladesh is not only India&#8217;s next door neighbour; India played a historic role when the people of former East Pakistan fought their war of independence against the Pakistani army. India, as media reports and analyses suggest, has maintained that the polls should be free, fair and credible, and that it is for the people of Bangladesh to decide who will form the next government.\n\n\n<b>Addressing Indian concerns</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIn recent years, Bangladesh has met some vital security concerns of India. Moves were made to restore regional connectivity which New Delhi wanted, including boosting of trade and commerce. All these, however, irked the Jamaat-e-Islami and its ally, the BNP. The BNP&#8217;s strong alliance with the Jamaat since 2001 and the Islamist militancy that developed when they shared power are cause for concern.\n\n\nThe resurgence of new radicals like the madrasa-based Hefazet-e-Islam, patronised by both the Jamaat and the BNP are also seen as being inimical to the interests of a stable, democratic Bangladesh. The U.S., which, ironically, considers the Jamaat as a &#8220;moderate Islamic party,&#8221; appears to think that the threat perception of Bangladesh&#8217;s liberals, perhaps shared by India, is overblown.\n\n\nChina was the firm ally of Pakistan in 1971, and it vetoed twice Bangladesh&#8217;s entry in the United Nations. However, Beijing&#8217;s relations with the Awami League developed in later years. For China, which maintains a significant military relationship with Bangladesh, a stable Bangladesh is important. Going beyond its tradition, it has made a number of public statements about the current political situation, calling for dialogue between the major parties.\n\n\nIn 1971, the former Soviet Union supported Bangladesh&#8217;s independence, as part of its alliance with India. During the tenure of the Sheikh Hasina government, relations were revived. However, Moscow has made no statement on the current political stalemate.\n\n\nThe European Union&#8217;s stated position is that it would like to see a participatory and credible election with a level-playing field. There are some who feel that as, according to the Bangladesh Constitution, elections must take place by January 24, 2014, it is irrelevant which party boycotts it. But an election without the participation of a major political party might lack credibility.\n\n\n<b>West&#8217;s stand</b><br/>\n<br/>\nMany pro-West civil society leaders in Bangladesh think India&#8217;s understanding of the Bangladesh situation may &#8220;backfire.&#8221; On the contrary, secular thinkers overwhelmingly see the U.S.&#8217;s understanding of the situation as a &#8220;sheer misjudgment.&#8221; They argue that the implementation of Washington&#8217;s stand may be &#8220;dangerous&#8221; for Bangladesh&#8217;s democratic future, as the &#8220;defeated forces&#8221; of 1971 may get a further boost.\n\n\nMany diplomatic experts say that India should not pursue a &#8220;one-friend policy&#8221; in Bangladesh. But it must neither pursue, they argue, a policy that harms secular &#8220;pro-liberation&#8221; forces and encourages religious fundamentalists and communalism. \n\nDemocracy, development and counter-terrorism are common among Washington and New Delhi''s concerns as stated. But India, perhaps, has an additional responsibility &#8212; of ensuring that it does not support the rebirth of militant and political Islam, against which Bangladesh was born 42 years ago.\n\n\nAs a political consensus is still remote and Bangladesh is firmly on its way to election, a vital question is: will the opposition succeed in undoing the electoral process? A significant population of Bangladesh will answer in the negative, even while admitting that the opposition might succeed in causing destabilisation resulting in death and destruction. The BNP&#8217;s weak organisational strength was evident in the recent anti-government campaign, when it was almost dependent on the hardcore Jamaat &#8220;cadres&#8221; whose prime concern is to undo the war crimes trial and get its convicted leaders freed. If this dependence continues, even many BNP leaders fear, the ultimate leadership of the opposition camp might be taken over by the Jamaat. There is a near-consensus that the violent means demonstrated in the recent street agitations have largely eroded the BNP&#8217;s popularity.\n\n\nA majority of people in Bangladesh wants a political consensus, so that a credible election can be held. However, there is a third option that always comes to mind when the country is in a political crisis: the intervention of the army. When the BNP-Jamaat coalition was in power (2001-06) and desperately wanted to be re-installed in power by holding a unilateral election in 2007, the military intervened covertly. Initially popular, the military-backed regime stayed in power for two years.

The BNP has opposed the &#8220;all party government&#8221; formed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to oversee national elections due in January 2014 and threatened to take to the streets. As a result, only parties in the Awami League-led ruling coalition are represented in the set-up. The roots of the present crisis go back to 2011, when the Hasina government amended the Constitution to abolish the caretaker system of government, which had been introduced in the mid-1990s to provide a non-partisan overseer for elections. The decision to do away with it was born out of first-hand experience of the perils of the caretaker system when a government of technocrats appointed for three months in 2006 stayed on for over two years with military backing. The abolition was opposed by the BNP, which also boycotted the vote on the amendment in Parliament, seeing it as a self-serving move by the Awami League. Since then, the country has moved from crisis to crisis, each segueing into the other, including massive violence that attended the trials to punish those who had cooperated with the Pakistan Army against the liberation of Bangladesh. Through all this, if BNP leader Khaleda Zia has been confrontationist, Prime Minister Hasina has hardly been reconciliatory. The ban imposed earlier this year on the Jamaat-e-Islami, a crucial ally of the BNP, did nothing to enhance the Awami League leadership&#8217;s democratic credentials, coming as it did shortly after the opposition combine convincingly won a clutch of municipal elections in the midst of the war crimes trials.\n\n\nWhat is required now is for both parties to acknowledge that they need to engage with each other constructively to ensure a peaceful democratic transition. An election boycott by the BNP, as the party has threatened, is no solution. As for the Awami League, victory in an election that is not contested by the main opposition party would be hollow. It will set the country on a fresh path of political confrontation. With the security situation in the entire region uncertain, several countries are now engaged in efforts to break the political deadlock in Dhaka. Already seen as pro-Hasina, New Delhi must do nothing that appears partial to any party. It is true that Sheikh Hasina has been a good friend of India, but New Delhi&#8217;s inability to reciprocate with a settlement on the Teesta river water dispute or on the land boundary issue has given the BNP a stick to beat the government with. It is in India&#8217;s interests to encourage the two main parties to find a way out of this impasse themselves, without taking sides.\n', 'political,main,political,demonstrate,high,national,due,military,other,massive,confrontationist,crucial,democratic,municipal,other,peaceful,democratic,main,fresh,political,entire,several,political,partial,true,good,main,', ' democratic fresh good peaceful true', '', 5, 0, 5, 5),

But the U.K. needed U.S. support. The Eisenhower administration in Washington was easily persuaded.\n\n\nBritish documents show how senior officials in the 1970s tried to stop Washington from releasing documents that would be &#8220;very embarrassing&#8221; to the U.K.\n\n\nOfficial papers in the U.K. remain secret, even though accounts of Britain&#8217;s role in the coup are widespread.

On Monday, the Foreign Office said it could neither confirm nor deny Britain&#8217;s involvement in the coup.\n\n\nThe previously classified U.S. documents include telegrams from Kermit Roosevelt, the senior CIA officer on the ground in Iran during the coup. Others, including a draft in-house CIA history by Scott Kock titled <i>Zendebad, Shah</i>! (Viva, Shah!), say that according to Monty Woodhouse, MI6&#8217;s station chief in Tehran at the time, Britain needed U.S. support for a coup. Eden agreed. &#8220;Woodhouse took his words as tantamount to permission to pursue the idea&#8221; with the U.S., Kock wrote.\n\n\nMosaddeq&#8217;s overthrow, still given as a reason for the Iranian mistrust of British and American politicians, consolidated the Shah&#8217;s rule for the next 26 years until the 1979 Islamic revolution. It was aimed at making sure the Iranian monarchy would safeguard the west&#8217;s oil interests in the country.\n\n\nThe archived CIA documents include a draft internal history of the coup titled <i>Campaign to install a pro-western government in Iran</i>, which defines the objective of the campaign as &#8220;through legal, or quasi-legal, methods to effect the fall of the Mosaddeq government; and to replace it with a pro-western government under the Shah&#8217;s leadership with Zahedi as its Prime Minister&#8221;.\n\n\nOne document describes Mosaddeq as one of the &#8220;most mercurial, maddening, adroit and provocative leaders with whom they [the U.S. and Britain] had ever dealt&#8221;. \n\nThe document says Mosaddeq &#8220;found the British evil, not incomprehensible&#8221; and &#8220;he and millions of Iranians believed that for centuries Britain had manipulated their country for British ends&#8221;.

With the governments in both the countries approaching the end of their respective tenures, there is urgency in building political consensus on The Constitution (One Hundred and Nineteenth) Amendment Bill, 2013, which seeks to ratify the agreement. The bill is likely to be introduced in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament.\n\n\nThe Bill has met with opposition on the grounds that &#8212; (i) the proposed exchange of enclaves will result in a national loss of 10,000 acres of land; (ii) it will fuel secessionist tendencies in other parts of India. This piece highlights why it is important to ratify the Indo-Bangladesh agreement on this matter in a timely manner.\n\n\n<b>What are enclaves?</b>\n\n\nIn international law, states exercise sovereignty over their territories. There is no requirement that the territory must be contiguous or geographically proximate. An example of geographically non-contiguous territories constituting one state is that of Pakistan before 1971. This possibility of territories lacking geographical contiguity forming parts of one state sometimes results in some parts being surrounded by the territory of another state. Such territories are termed enclaves. The situation can be further complicated by an enclave within an enclave (counter-enclave) or even an enclave within a counter-enclave (counter-counter-enclave).\n\n\nOne aspect of sovereignty enjoyed by states is a near-absolute right to restrict or regulate access to and transportation in their territories. This results in practical difficulties in the context of enclaves. Being surrounded by the territory of another state, the residents of an enclave cannot travel to their &#8216;home state&#8217; without crossing international borders and obtaining the necessary permission for the same. Similarly, governmental agencies of the home state cannot access the enclave, despite its sovereignty over it, without the permission of the state that surrounds the enclave. In the absence of specific international agreements between the states concerned, this results in the exclusion of governmental services, essential facilities and opportunities to residents of enclaves, counter-enclaves and counter-counter enclaves.\n\n\nThese rules and practical problems relating to enclaves came to India&#8217;s aid during the liberation of Portuguese possessions in the region. Dadra and Nagar Haveli, over which Portugal claimed sovereignty, were &#8220;enclaved&#8221; within Indian territory, and could not be accessed from other Portuguese possessions without crossing Indian territory. In 1954, when Portuguese authorities wished to contain the uprising in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, India refused the right of passage to Portuguese officers, armed forces, etc.. Though Portugal challenged India&#8217;s action before the International Court of Justice, the Court found that India was within its rights in international law to refuse permission to the Portuguese authorities to access the enclaves through Indian territory. This clearly highlights how the practical and legal difficulties in accessing enclaves can render sovereignty over them illusory.\n\n\nAs per the joint verification carried out by the Indian and Bangladeshi governments in April 1997, there are 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in India. These include a few counter-enclaves, which are enclaves within enclaves, as well as a counter-counter enclave &#8212; a parcel of Bangladeshi territory surrounded by Indian territory, itself surrounded by Bangladeshi territory! In India, these slivers of Bangladesh are in the States of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura. The residents of these enclaves do not enjoy the same basic amenities that the mainland citizens of their country enjoy, only for practical problems of access. The residents find it difficult to travel outside their enclaves either, since they have no opportunity to obtain valid travel documents. They are essentially prisoners within those enclaves, with fewer facilities than prisoners in these countries enjoy. The same is, of course, true of residents of the Indian enclaves surrounded by Bangladeshi territory.\n\n\n<b>Exchange of land</b>\n\n\nBy the Land Boundary Agreement of 1974 between the two countries, and the 2011 Protocol to the said Agreement, India and Bangladesh agreed to exchange these small parcels of land and better demarcate the land boundary between them. The borders of the Indian States of Assam, West Bengal, Meghalaya and Tripura will be affected by this exchange of territory. This Agreement has not been implemented yet. The Constitution (One Hundred and Nineteenth) Amendment Bill, 2013 proposes to give effect to this proposed land exchange. This long overdue exchange will endeavour to harmonise India&#8217;s land boundaries and, more importantly, improve the lives of all those residents of the enclaves who, by an unfortunate twist of fate, have been living without a national identity and without enjoying or ever knowing the quality of life enjoyed by their neighbours.\n\n\nIf one were to compare the area of land that India receives in this exchange to what India gives away, the former falls short of the latter by 10,000 acres. While it may appear like a net loss of territory, such loss is illusory. What we lose are enclaves we cannot access, govern or use in any way without the consent of Bangladesh. The enclaves surrounded by Bangladeshi territory were never part of any political campaigns, never on the agenda for development or reforms of any kind. In fact, except on paper, mainland India would never know the loss of those territories.\n\n\nIt would also be a great stretch of imagination to believe that such a land exchange can give rise to calls for secession in other parts of India. An enclave is a very unique position, geographically and administratively &#8212; they cannot be compared to any other situation worldwide. Claiming a right to secede is an expression of the will of the people (whether rightfully or otherwise). Amending the Constitution of India to give effect to the exchange of these parcels of land is not an expression of the will of the people residing in those land areas. \n\nEven if the residents of an Indian enclave in Bangladesh wished to remain part of Indian territory, it would be an administrative nightmare (as it has been for the past several decades). Whether they wish to remain Indian, and seek to relocate to India, is a separate question. Thus, the proposed transfer, unlike secession, is motivated by the need for efficient administration and for the welfare of those residing in those regions rather than dictated by the will of the people.\n\n\n<b>No more gambles please</b>\n\n\nAccording to some sources, the Indo-Bangladesh enclaves have their origins in chess games between the Raja of Cooch Behar and the Nawab of Rangpur who wagered in these territories. The outcomes of these wagers have meant virtual exclusion from of all governmental services and denial of essential facilities for the residents of these territories for decades. While The Constitution (One Hundred and Nineteenth) Amendment Bill, 2013 proposes a solution, due care must be taken to ensure that another series of political wagers does not prolong the sad state of affairs.\n\n\n<i>(Rukmini Das is pursuing her Masters in International Dispute Settlement at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva.

NVVN has been nominated as the nodal agency for supply of power to Bangladesh.\n\n\nThe development comes close on heels of Bangladesh Joint Secretary (Power), Mohammad Anwar Hossain handing over the sovereign guarantee to NVVN, CEO Nand Kishore Sharma in Dhaka on August 7. A sovereign guarantee is an instrument of payment security against supply of the 250 MW for 25 years from various power stations of NTPC under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between NVVN and BPDB in February last year. The energy agreement with Bangladesh is on similar lines with other neighbours like Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\n\n\nThe Nawz Sharif government in Pakistan Government was very keen on entering into an agreement with India to supply of 500 MW of power in the first phase and expand the relationship later on. Pakistan is faced with a serious deficit of power and the country faces massive power cuts and load shedding. A delegation from Pakistan was expected to be in India this month for talks for purchase of 500 MW of power but in view of the fresh development on the Poonch border, this move is likely to take a backseat for the time being. India also plans to import nearly 5000 MW of power by 2020. \n\nIt is learnt that the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has already entered into negotiations with the Indian authorities including the Power Ministry for supply of another 250 MW in the near future. The electrical grid interconnection between the two countries will be through a 1X500 MW HVDC back-to-back asynchronous link between Eastern region of India and Western Grid of Bangladesh would facilitate cross-border power transfer of 500 MW across the two countries.\n\n\nThe HVDC 500 MW unit has been established at Bheramara. On the India side, 400 kV switching station has been set up at Baharampur in West Bengal by loop-in-loop out of the existing 400 kV Farakka-Jeerat S/C line. The cross-border inter-connection has been established by Baharampur (India)-Bheramara (Bangladesh) 400 kV D/C line.\n', 'big,next,various,last,similar,other,first,later,serious,massive,fresh,likely,learnt,electrical,asynchronous,', ' fresh', ' serious', 1, -1, 0, 2),

Soon after the tribunal &#8212; set up to investigate mass atrocities committed during the war for Bangladesh&#8217;s independence in 1971 &#8212; announced its decision, Jamaat activists took to the streets, torching vehicles, blasting crude bombs, roughing up policemen and vandalising public property. Political violence is expected to escalate over the next few days, now that Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mojaheed has been sentenced to death by a similar tribunal. Whatever the Islamist party may say or do, most Bangladeshis wish to see 1971&#8217;s perpetrators brought to book. The protests in Shahbag earlier this year saw huge crowds demanding even capital punishment for those convicted of war crimes. The Jamaat, which saw in this groundswell of anger an existential threat, has since retaliated with violence.\n\n\nTo be sure, the dispensation of justice in these cases should neither be an exercise in retribution nor do away with the rule of law to assuage popular sentiment. Thus far, the ruling Awami League has failed to cultivate a <i>modus vivendi</i> between the belligerence of foot soldiers beholden to the Jamaat and the impassioned, but adamant, stance of those seeking death for the party&#8217;s former leadership. If the war crime trials are to bring closure to a horrific chapter in Bangladesh&#8217;s history, they must be seen at home and abroad as adhering to due process &#8212; in gathering evidence, protecting witnesses, and hearing both sides. The special tribunals, it has been alleged, have not fully complied with their rules of procedure as laid down in the International Crimes Tribunal Act, 1973. Far from addressing this serious concern, Prime Minister Hasina and her government have glossed over it, with a view to winding up the trials in time for the upcoming general elections. On its part, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has chosen, unconscionably, to side with the Jamaat in decrying the push for justice. Both mainstream political parties must realise electoral dividends are a cheap substitute for national reconciliation. Already the events of 1971 have demonstrated their potential to hold captive the popular imagination of younger generations.

Pretty soon we&#8217;ll be having lunch in our oceanfront restaurant.&#8221;\nThe Bangladeshi who had sought the materials, Rizve Ahmed, paid $1,000 to Lustyik and Thaler for two documents concerning his political rival, the complaint said. One was a suspicious activity report and the other a memo about the man that mentioned $300 million, the complaint said without elaboration. The men planned to seek tens of thousands of dollars in additional bribes for other confidential information, the complaint said.\nThe complaint did not identify the rival, whom the office of Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, described as &#8220;a prominent citizen of Bangladesh who was affiliated with an opposing political party&#8221; of Mr. Ahmed&#8217;s.\nMr. Bharara called Lustyik&#8217;s actions &#8220;particularly egregious&#8221; given that he was an agent who was &#8220;willing to compromise the operations&#8221; of the FBI. \nLustyik&#8217;s lawyer, Raymond Mansolillo, said: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to fight the allegations. They&#8217;re basically snippets of text messages and emails that the government has taken out of context and misconstrued as illegal, which we strongly refute.&#8221;\nLustyik is in his early 50s; he worked in counterintelligence, the complaint said. He retired in September after more than two decades with the bureau, an official said. Thaler and Ahmed were also charged. \nLustyik had already been indicted in Salt Lake City on federal charges related to what the government has called a scheme to use his official position to derail an investigation of a business partner. He has pleaded not guilty and has been detained there without bond. In the New York case, when Mr. Ahmed indicated that he and his associates might turn to another source for information, apparently an FBI agent who had retired, Lustyik responded angrily, telling Thaler in one message that they had to &#8220;squeeze&#8221; Ahmed, the complaint said. <b>&#8212; New York Times News Service </b>', 'former,special,confidential,political,native,late,criminal,close,political,suspicious,other,additional,other,confidential,political,illegal,early,federal,guilty,', ' special', ' close criminal guilty illegal suspicious', 1, -5, -4, 6);

Though everyone more or less agrees that the perpetrators must be brought to book, the desire of the two major political parties to use the tribunal to further their own political ends has created unexpected consequences.\n\n\nThe Bangladeshi people are struggling to choose between two &#8220;quarrelling Begums&#8221; who head parties that have between them ruled the country for the past two decades, each successive government worse than the one it replaced. For both these parties, sustaining an ideological division among people is critical for diverting attention from other issues such as corruption.\n\n\nFor the Awami League, keeping up the division between pro- and anti-liberation forces is critical for sustaining its political grip. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), meanwhile, claims to be the one that will &#8220;save Islam&#8221; and rides the tide of nationalist sentiment. Barring this superficial debate, the two parties are practically two sides of the same coin.\n\n\nThe Awami League government under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which started off well, had begun to look vulnerable from its fourth year in office. The World Bank-Padma Bridge fiasco, the share market collapse, and bank loan scandals have all rocked the government. In the midst of this came the rumour that the government was making a secret pact with the Jamaat to wean them away from their electoral alliance with the BNP. When Jamaat member Kader Molla, convicted in one of the most notorious cases before the WCT, was given a life sentence instead of the death penalty, the suspicions of a back door deal grew.\n\n\nOutrage over the verdict led urban youth to gather in Shahbag square in Dhaka, demanding nothing less than the hanging of convicted war criminals. The movement had all the elements of an anti-establishment revolution. In the first few days water bottles were hurled at government ministers who tried to get on the central podium. But the Awami League displayed great political acumen in eventually appropriating the Shahbag movement. Influential members of the intellectual elite worked to channel Shahbag&#8217;s message in ways that the government&#8217;s own narrative was not disrupted. Thus was a potential revolution hijacked by the ruling party.\n\n\nIn traditional Bangla style, when the Awami League appropriated Shahbag, the BNP took on the role of delegitimising it. Mahmudur Rahman, editor of the daily <i>Amar Desh</i>, took over the role of portraying the Shahbag Movement as an &#8220;anti Islamic&#8221; movement. The opportunity came with the discovery that a murdered member of the Shahbag movement was an &#8220;atheist blogger&#8221; writing as &#8220;Thaba Baba.&#8221; \n\nRahman was successful in getting religious scholars all worked up by reprinting Thaba Baba&#8217;s blogs, which had sentences and words directly insulting the Prophet and his family. These articles were photocopied and distributed in villages. People across the country were agitated that the Prophet had been insulted, and a counter-Shahbag movement brewed.\n\n\n<b>More unrest</b>\n\n\nBangladesh was poised for a showdown and the occasion was provided by the next verdict at the tribunal, against Delowar Hossain Sayedee. Though Sayedee is a member of the Jamaat-e-Islami, he has a huge personal following as a cleric who regularly criss-crosses the country to address mass congregations. After the death sentence was given to Sayedee, countrywide protests erupted, which led to the burning of government offices, the killing of policemen, and firing by the police that took many lives. But it was difficult to discern what had set it off &#8212; his popularity, the anger over the defamation of the Prophet, or the Jamaat taking advantage of the situation to create anarchy.\n\n\nThe subsequent turn of events included the arrest of Mahmudur Rahman, and the closure of his paper, the arrest of a few bloggers to appease the Islamists, and the rise of a new Islamist movement under the banner of Hefazat-e-Islam.\n\n\nIt is a generally held belief that due to their association with the 1971 war crimes and its perpetrators, Islamists would never gain grassroot popularity. The Jamaat-e-Islami especially would always have to depend on either the BNP or the Awami League for survival. But the Hefajat-e-Islam, which consists of the students of the Kawmi Madrasa, do not have the &#8220;anti liberation force&#8221; stigma attached to them. They are also known to have ideological differences with the Jamaat-e-Islami. For its protest against the Shahbag movement &#8212; during which it also presented an Islamist wishlist &#8212; the group was able to gather huge numbers of supporters. However, there are analysts who claim that the Hefajat is just a front for the Jamaat. There was a midnight crackdown by the police and paramilitary forces on the Hefazat&#8217;s protest. Two television channels were shut down by removing their transmission machinery. Interestingly, on the same night, the government also demolished the podium of the Shahbag protesters.\n\n\n<b>Insecurity</b>\n\n\nThe volatile environment has given rise to all kinds of rumours about a &#8220;third force&#8221; &#8212; that could be the military, or a select civil society group preferred by India, or Pakistan, or even Dr. Muhammad Yunus of the Grameen Bank, backed by America.

In May this year, the war crimes tribunal indicted him on five charges of crimes against humanity based on 61 incidents of murder and torture of unarmed people; and conspiracy, incitement and complicity to commit genocide and crimes against humanity.\nThe indictment order said that at the time of the war in 1971 all leaders and workers of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Sangha, later renamed as Islami Chatra Shibir, opposed, under Ghulam Azam&#8217;s leadership, the Bangladesh liberation movement.\nSixteen prosecution witnesses, including seven seizure-list witnesses and the investigation officer, testified against Azam, while his son alone gave evidence in his defence. One of the charges against Azam was that he was involved in the torture and murder of 38 people. The Pakistani forces with the help of their local cohorts &#8212; Razakar and Al Badr &#8212; killed them after receiving an order from him. \nThe tribunal also charged Azam with conspiring to commit crimes against humanity across Bangladesh on six occasions.

(992, '258', 'July 8, 2013', 'http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/economic-reasoning-in-energy-security/article4895429.ece', '\nEnergy security is a much discussed topic and is a vital element of energy policy as well as foreign policy. But it has not been defined precisely. \n\nThis book starts with a working definition: &#8216;&#8216;energy security means having access to the requisite volumes of energy at affordable prices&#8221;. The supply of energy must be &#8220;impervious to disruptions&#8221; and sufficient quantity must be available in time from a variety of sources. \n\nThe concept is location-specific. Some countries advocate import of fossil fuel, some development of renewable energy and others nuclear power, leading one economist to remark, &#8220;If you cannot think of a reasoned rationale for some policy based on standard economic reasoning, and then argue that the policy is necessary to promote energy security&#8221;. \n\nThe Indian Planning Commission states, &#8220;We are energy secure when we can supply lifeline energy to all our citizens irrespective of their ability to pay for it as well as meet their effective demand for safe and convenient energy to satisfy their various needs at competitive prices at all times and with a prescribed confidence level considering shocks and disruptions that can be reasonably expected&#8221;. \n\nIn South Asia &#8212; the region of the study by Charles K. Ebinger of the Brookings Institution &#8212; shortfall in energy slows down growth, and not providing electrical power to the poorer sections of the society breeds a &#8220;million mutinies&#8221;. Compounding the problem, this region is also vulnerable to climate change, water scarcity and the consequent mass migrations.\n\n\nThe majority of the people depend on biomass, fuel wood and waste products for household energy consumption which results in indoor air pollution. A country-wise analysis of commercial energy shows India depends on coal and needs to invest in super-critical boiler technology and carbon capture and sequestration. \n\nPakistan and Bangladesh have natural gas. Pakistan is probably the world&#8217;s largest user of CNG in automobiles. Nepal uses mostly combustible biomass and oil, coal and hydro. Water is to Bhutan what oil is to Saudi Arabia. Nuclear energy is being developed only in India and Pakistan.\n\n\nIndia and Pakistan are reported to have &#8220;technically recoverable resources&#8221; of 96 and 105 trillion cubic feet of wet shale gas, respectively. The uncertainty in estimates and possible change in production rates with time must be kept in mind. The process to release natural gas from underground rocks by horizontal drilling, known as fracking, uses water, sand and chemicals under pressure. There are apprehensions that ground water may become contaminated and earthquakes may occur. Hence, environment-conscious engineers must take on the leadership in developing this technology. \n\nIn addition to domestic reforms, bilateral and multilateral cooperation is needed but there is a history of lost opportunities. The Iran-Pakistan-India and Myanmar-Bangladesh-India natural gas pipelines are in limbo due to international politics. India is planning a 1100 km sub-sea pipeline from Oman. The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline will transport 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day over 1700 km. Both projects are subject to political and economic uncertainties. \n\nIt is not often realised that energy security depends on availability of critical materials. Lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles can become scarce and rare earths used in magnets in wind mills are available mainly in China. Materials used in solar energy such as gallium, arsenic, selenium, indium, and tellurium are getting depleted quickly. Either new sources must be discovered or combinations of alternative materials, which are not in short supply, must be developed.\n\n\nThe book is easy to read and is organised well. The author provides an executive summary in the form of policy prescriptions. The longest coverage is devoted to India, while Pakistan and Bangladesh get a chapter each and Nepal and Bhutan are discussed together in a chapter.\n\n\nEach chapter has 3 headings: energy history, current energy landscape, and conclusions and recommendations. Energy challenges in the regional context and regional cooperation are outlined next and the book concludes with a chapter on South Asia&#8217;s path forward. \n\nThe other SAARC countries &#8212; Afghanistan, Maldives and Sri Lanka &#8212; are not included. There is no coverage of energy critical elements or fracking. The book is free of jargon and 24 pages of notes guide the reader through the maze of organisations and their publications. It will be useful to anyone interested in energy including policy makers, energy professionals and funding agencies. \n\nThe author has taken the risk of using a question in the title: cooperation or conflict? But one does not get an answer. Given the high stakes, countries must learn to put the energy agenda ahead of political compulsions in order to lead their teeming millions from darkness to light.\n\n\n(<i>N.

The court said Interpol would be asked to execute the warrant.\nTarique, the senior vice-chairman of the opposition BNP, has been staying in London for six years. He was detained in 2007 by the military backed caretaker government but was allowed to travel abroad for &#8220;treatment&#8221; in 2008. He faces 15 cases for laundering money and also for grenade attack on a rally in August 2004, when Sheikh Hasina, now Prime Minister, miraculously survived but 22 leaders of the then opposition Awami League were killed . \nAnti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed a case against Tarique and Giasuddin Al Mamun, an associate and business partner of Tarique, for laundering Tk 20.41 crore to Singapore between 2003 and 2007 . In August 2011, a Dhaka court framed charges against Tarique and issued an arrest warrant against him. Ms. Khaleda&#8217;s younger son, Arafat Rahman &#8220;Koko&#8221; &#8212; living abroad since 2008 &#8212; is also facing charges of money laundering . His counsel said the High Court had stayed proceedings in 12 cases taking place in the lower courts.\nHaving maintained a low profile for several years, Tarique was recently in news when he attended a BNP function in East London on May 20 and delivered a fiery anti-government speech. With present government&#8217;s tenure nearing completion, Tarique has been indicating a return to energise the opposition party, now facing hard times due to war crimes trial and its alliance with radical Islamists, including Jamaat-e-Islami and Hefazat-e-Islam. His mother, who wants her son to take the party leadership, has also started lobbying at an international level to put pressure on the government not to harass Tarique on his return.
